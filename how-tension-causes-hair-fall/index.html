This hormone can lead to hair fall by disrupting the natural hair growth cycle. When cortisol levels are high, it can cause hair follicles to enter a resting phase, leading to hair fall.</p><p>Additionally, cortisol can also cause inflammation in the body, leading to damage to hair follicles. This damage can lead to hair fall and thinning hair. Moreover, tension can also lead to poor eating habits, sleep deprivation, and other lifestyle factors that can contribute to hair fall.</p><h2 id="tips-to-prevent-hair-fall">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall</h2><p>Preventing hair fall caused by tension requires a holistic approach that addresses both the physical and mental aspects of stress. Here are some tips to prevent hair fall:</p><h3>1. Practice Stress-Relieving Techniques</h3><p>Practicing stress-relieving techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help reduce tension and cortisol levels in the body.

Foods such as eggs, nuts, leafy greens, and fish are excellent for hair health.</p><h3>3. Get Enough Sleep</h3><p>Getting enough sleep is essential for overall health and can also prevent hair fall.

Instead, opt for loose hairstyles that do not put too much pressure on the hair.</p><h3>2. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair instead of a brush. A brush can cause breakage and damage to the hair.</p><h3>3. Massage Your Scalp</h3><p>Massaging your scalp can help improve blood circulation and promote hair growth. Use your fingers to massage your scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>1. Is hair fall due to tension permanent?</h3><p>No, hair fall due to tension is not permanent. Once the underlying cause of tension is addressed, hair fall can be prevented and new hair growth can occur.</p><h3>2.

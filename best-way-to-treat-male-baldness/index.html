It is also known as androgenetic alopecia and is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. Male pattern baldness is the most common type of baldness and affects approximately 50% of men by the age of 50. However, there are several other types of baldness, including alopecia areata, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss in patches. Regardless of the type of baldness, it can be a source of self-consciousness and social anxiety for many men.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Treat Male Baldness</h2><p>The best way to treat male baldness is to address the underlying cause of the hair loss. For example, if the hair loss is caused by stress, reducing stress levels can help prevent further hair loss.

There are also several medical treatments available for male baldness, including:</p><ul><li>Topical minoxidil â a medication applied to the scalp to promote hair growth</li><li>Oral finasteride â a medication that blocks the production of DHT, a hormone that causes hair loss</li><li>Hair transplants â a surgical procedure that moves hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another</li></ul><p>It is important to note that these treatments may not work for everyone, and they may have side effects.

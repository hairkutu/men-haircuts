If you are not sure which guard to use, start with the longest one and work your way down until you reach the desired length.</p><h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Follow these steps to cut men's hair with clippers:</p><ol><li>Prepare the person's hair by washing it and combing it. Wet hair is easier to cut and combing it will remove any tangles or knots.</li><li>Cover the person with a cape or towel to protect their clothes from hair clippings.</li><li>Choose the guard size you want to use and attach it to the clippers.</li><li>Start at the back of the head and work your way up. Use the clippers to cut the hair against the direction it grows. Move the clippers from the bottom of the head upwards.</li><li>Use the comb to lift the hair and trim the longer parts with the scissors. This will give a more even look to the haircut.</li><li>Move to the sides of the head and follow the same pattern. Use the comb to lift the hair and trim it with the scissors.</li><li>Cut the hair at the top of the head. Use the longest guard and cut the hair from the front to the back. This will give a more natural look to the haircut.</li><li>Blend the hair from the sides to the top. Use a shorter guard and move the clippers in an upward motion to blend the hair from the sides to the top.</li><li>Trim the hairline around the ears and the neck. Use a shorter guard or no guard at all to trim the hairline around the ears and the neck. This will give a more polished look to the haircut.</li><li>Clean the clippers and scissors with a brush and oil. Remove any hair clippings from the person's clothes.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for a Great Haircut</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get a great haircut:</p><ul><li>Practice makes perfect.

This will help you see any uneven parts and adjust them.</li><li>Keep the clippers and scissors clean and sharp. This will make the haircut easier and faster.</li><li>Use a spray bottle to wet the hair if it gets dry. Dry hair is harder to cut and can cause the clippers to pull the hair.</li><li>Don't cut too much hair at once. It's better to cut small sections and check the length than to cut too much and have to start over.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can I cut my own hair with clippers?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own hair with clippers. Use a mirror to see the back of your head and follow the same steps as you would with someone else.</p><h3>What if I make a mistake?</h3><p>Don't worry if you make a mistake.

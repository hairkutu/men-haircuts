Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Use a curling iron or wand</h3><p>To create waves in your hair, use a curling iron or wand.

Braid your hair before bed</h3><p>Another way to achieve wavy hair is to braid your hair before bed. The tighter the braid, the tighter the waves will be. In the morning, gently undo the braid and run your fingers through your hair to create loose waves.</p><h3>3. Use sea salt spray</h3><p>To enhance your natural waves, use a sea salt spray. This will give your hair a beachy texture and create more defined waves.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve the most attractive hair type female:</p><h3>1. Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. This will give your hair body and texture.</p><h3>2.

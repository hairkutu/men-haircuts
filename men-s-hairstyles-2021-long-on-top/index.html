This style has been popular for several years now, and it's not hard to see why. It's versatile, easy to style, and can work for a range of hair types and face shapes. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about men's hairstyles 2021 long on top, including how to achieve the look, tips for maintenance, and more.</p><h2>How to Achieve the Look</h2><p>The long on top hairstyle typically features longer hair on the top of the head, with shorter hair on the sides and back. To achieve the look, you'll need to grow out the hair on top of your head. This can take several months, depending on how fast your hair grows. Once you have the desired length, you can style it in a variety of ways, such as slicking it back, creating a side part, or letting it hang loose.</p><p>To keep the sides and back of your hair shorter, you'll need to visit a barber or hairstylist regularly. They can help you maintain the length and shape of your hair, so it stays looking neat and tidy.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're not sure how to style your long on top hair, here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair. If your hair is wet, blow-dry it on a low heat setting until it's completely dry.</li><li>Apply a small amount of styling product to your hair. This could be a pomade, wax, or gel, depending on the type of look you're going for.</li><li>Use a comb to style your hair. You can slick it back, create a side part, or let it hang loose. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for you.</li><li>Finish with a light hairspray to keep your hair in place.</li></ol><p>Remember, the key to the long on top hairstyle is to keep the sides and back of your hair shorter. This will help create contrast and make the longer hair on top stand out.</p><h2>Tips for Maintenance</h2><p>To keep your long on top hairstyle looking its best, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Visit a barber or hairstylist regularly. They can help you maintain the length and shape of your hair.</li><li>Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy.</li><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that's suited for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as with a blow dryer or straightener. This can damage your hair and make it harder to style.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about men's hairstyles 2021 long on top:</p><h3>What face shape is best suited for the long on top hairstyle?</h3><p>The long on top hairstyle can work for a range of face shapes, but it's particularly suited for oval or round faces. The longer hair on top helps elongate the face and create a more balanced look.</p><h3>What type of hair works best for the long on top hairstyle?</h3><p>The long on top hairstyle can work for a range of hair types, including straight, wavy, and curly hair. However, it's important to choose a hairstyle that's suited for your hair type. For example, if you have curly hair, you may want to keep the sides and back of your hair shorter to avoid a triangular shape.</p><h3>Can I style my long on top hair in different ways?</h3><p>Yes! One of the great things about the long on top hairstyle is that it's versatile and can be styled in a variety of ways. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for you.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your hair looking its best, it's important to take care of it. Here are some tips for hair care:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a shampoo and conditioner that's suited for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as with a blow dryer or straightener.</li><li>Use a hair mask or deep conditioner once a week to keep your hair healthy and nourished.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends.</li></ul><p>By following these tips, you can keep your long on top hairstyle looking its best for years to come.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The long on top hairstyle is a stylish and versatile look that's perfect for men who want to update their hairstyle in 2021.

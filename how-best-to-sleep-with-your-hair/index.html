Here are some tips to help you sleep better and wake up with gorgeous hair:</p><h3>1. Brush Your Hair Before Bed</h3><p>Brushing your hair before bed can help prevent tangles and knots. Use a wide-tooth comb or a brush with soft bristles to gently brush your hair from the roots to the ends. This will distribute the natural oils in your hair and prevent it from becoming too oily or dry.</p><h3>2. Use a Silk or Satin Pillowcase</h3><p>Silk or satin pillowcases are gentle on your hair and prevent it from getting tangled or frizzy. These materials also help to retain moisture in your hair, which can make it look healthier and shinier.</p><h3>3. Tie Your Hair Up</h3><p>Tying your hair up in a loose ponytail or bun can help prevent tangles and knots. Make sure to use a hair tie that is gentle on your hair, such as a scrunchie or a ribbon.</p><h3>4. Avoid Sleeping with Wet Hair</h3><p>Sleeping with wet hair can cause damage and breakage. Make sure to dry your hair completely before going to bed. If you don't have time to blow-dry your hair, try air-drying it or using a hair dryer on a low setting.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to sleep with your hair:</p><h3>1.

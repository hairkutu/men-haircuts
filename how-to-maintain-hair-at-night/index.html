From exposure to pollution, UV rays, and heat styling, our hair undergoes a lot of wear and tear. Therefore, it is crucial to take care of our hair at night because it is the time when our hair gets a chance to recover and rejuvenate. Proper hair care routine at night can help in reducing hair fall, hair breakage, and help maintain the natural shine and texture of your hair.</p><h2 id="how-to-maintain-hair-at-night">How to maintain hair at night</h2><p>The best way to maintain hair at night is by following a proper hair care routine. Here are some tips that you can follow to maintain your hair at night:</p><h3>1. Brush your hair</h3><p>Before going to bed, make sure to brush your hair thoroughly.

Using a soft scrunchie or a hairband made of silk or satin can also help in preventing hair breakage.</p><h3>3. Use a silk or satin pillowcase</h3><p>Sleeping on a silk or satin pillowcase can help in reducing friction between the hair and the pillowcase, which can cause hair breakage and damage. Silk and satin also help in retaining the natural oils in the hair and reduce frizz.</p><h3>4.

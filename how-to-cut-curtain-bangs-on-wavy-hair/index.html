They're called "curtain" bangs because they resemble a pair of curtains that are pulled apart. This hairstyle works well on wavy hair because the natural texture adds dimension and movement to the bangs. Cutting curtain bangs on wavy hair is relatively easy, but it does require some precision. It's essential to take your time and follow the steps carefully to get the best results.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut Curtain Bangs on Wavy Hair</h2><p>The first step to cutting curtain bangs on wavy hair is to gather the necessary tools. You'll need sharp hair scissors, a comb, hair clips, and a mirror.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Follow these steps to cut curtain bangs on wavy hair:</p><ol><li>Wash and dry your hair. It's best to cut your bangs when your hair is dry and styled the way you typically wear it. This will help you see how your bangs will look with your hair's natural texture.</li><li>Part your hair down the middle. Use the comb to create a straight part down the middle of your head. This will help you create even bangs on both sides of your face.</li><li>Section off the hair you want to cut. Use the comb to create a triangle-shaped section of hair at the front of your head. The base of the triangle should be at the top of your forehead, and the point should be at the bridge of your nose.</li><li>Clip the rest of your hair back. Use the hair clips to pin back the hair that you don't want to cut.</li><li>Start cutting. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it straight across. Be careful not to cut too much at once. It's better to cut a little bit at a time to avoid making mistakes.</li><li>Create the shape. Once you've cut the hair straight across, comb it down and check the length. If it's too long, trim a little bit more. If it's too short, you'll have to wait for it to grow out. Then, cut the corners of the bangs at a slight angle to create a softer, more natural shape.</li><li>Repeat on the other side. Follow the same steps on the other side of your face to create even bangs.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Curtain Bangs on Wavy Hair</h3><p>Here are some additional tips to help you cut curtain bangs on wavy hair:</p><ul><li>Take your time.

You can always cut more later, but you can't put hair back once it's been cut.</li><li>Check the length. Comb your bangs down frequently to check the length and make sure they're even.</li><li>Trim the corners. Cutting the corners of your bangs at a slight angle will create a softer, more natural look.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting curtain bangs on wavy hair:</p><ul><li><strong>Can I cut my own curtain bangs?</strong> Yes, you can cut your own curtain bangs at home.

You may need to trim them every few weeks or every few months.</li><li><strong>Can I wear my curtain bangs with a ponytail?</strong> Yes, curtain bangs look great with a ponytail. They can also be styled with loose waves or straight hair.</li></ul><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Wavy Hair</h2><p>Here are some hair care tips to keep your wavy hair healthy and looking great:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons too often. They can damage your hair and make it look dry and frizzy.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to the ends of your hair to keep them moisturized.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's wet.

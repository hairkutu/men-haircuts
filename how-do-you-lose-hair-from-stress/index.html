Hair has a growth phase, a rest phase, and a shedding phase. When you're stressed, your body releases hormones that can disrupt this cycle. As a result, more hair follicles enter the shedding phase, leading to hair loss. This is known as telogen effluvium.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The best way to prevent hair loss from stress is to manage your stress levels. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Exercise is a great way to reduce stress levels. It releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. Exercise also improves blood flow to the scalp, which can promote hair growth.</p><h3>Meditation</h3><p>Meditation is another effective way to reduce stress. It helps you focus on the present moment and calm your mind. This can lower your cortisol levels and reduce the risk of hair loss.</p><h3>Sleep</h3><p>Getting enough sleep is essential for managing stress. Lack of sleep can increase cortisol levels, which can lead to hair loss. Aim for at least seven hours of sleep per night.</p><h3>Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet can also help reduce stress levels. Avoid processed foods and sugar, which can increase inflammation in the body.

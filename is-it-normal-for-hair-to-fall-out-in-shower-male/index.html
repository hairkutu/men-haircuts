Is it Normal for Hair to Fall Out in Shower Male? The answer is yes, it is normal for hair to fall out in the shower. In fact, it is estimated that we lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day, and this can often be more noticeable when we are washing our hair.

Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair gently. 4. Avoid using heat styling tools like blow dryers and flat irons. 5.

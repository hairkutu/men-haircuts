Inside Edition</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>COVID-19 has affected our lives in many ways, and one of the most concerning questions is whether the virus can stay on hair. With so much misinformation out there, it's important to get the facts straight. In this article, we'll answer the question "do COVID stay on hair?" and provide tips on how to keep your hair clean and healthy during these challenging times.</p><h2>How Does COVID-19 Spread?</h2><p>COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can land on surfaces and objects, including hair. If a person comes into contact with these droplets and then touches their face, they can become infected with the virus.</p><h2>Do COVID Stay on Hair?</h2><p>There is still limited information on whether COVID-19 can stay on hair for a long time. However, experts believe that the virus can stay on hair for a short period, just like any other surface.</p><p>According to a study published in the <em>Journal of Hospital Infection</em>, COVID-19 can stay on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on copper for up to 4 hours. While the study did not specifically test hair, it suggests that the virus may not stay on hair for more than a few hours.</p><h2>How to Keep Your Hair Clean and Healthy During COVID-19</h2><p>Although the risk of COVID-19 transmission through hair is low, it's still important to keep your hair clean and healthy to prevent the spread of the virus. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly with a mild shampoo to remove any dirt or oil that may harbor the virus. It's also important to avoid sharing hair care items such as combs, brushes, and hair ties.</p><h3>2. Avoid Touching Your Hair</h3><p>Avoid touching your hair as much as possible, especially if you've been in contact with someone who may have the virus. If you need to adjust your hair, wash your hands first.</p><h3>3. Wear a Hat or Hair Covering</h3><p>If you're in a high-risk environment, such as a hospital or public transportation, consider wearing a hat or hair covering to protect your hair from respiratory droplets.</p><h3>4. Practice Good Hygiene</h3><p>Practice good hygiene by washing your hands regularly and avoiding touching your face. This will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to your hair.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can COVID-19 be spread through hair products?</h3><p>A: There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be spread through hair products. However, it's still important to wash your hands before using hair products to reduce the risk of transmission.</p><h3>Q: Can COVID-19 be transmitted through hair salons?</h3><p>A: The risk of COVID-19 transmission in hair salons is low if proper safety measures are followed, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and sanitizing equipment.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips During COVID-19</h2><p>During these challenging times, it's important to take care of your hair to maintain its health and prevent damage. Here are some hair care tips:</p><h3>1. Use a Moisturizing Shampoo</h3><p>Use a moisturizing shampoo to keep your hair hydrated and healthy. Avoid using hot water, which can strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>2. Condition Regularly</h3><p>Condition your hair regularly to keep it soft and shiny. Leave the conditioner on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.</p><h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools such as hair dryers, flat irons, and curling irons, which can damage your hair. Instead, let your hair air dry or use a low-heat setting.</p><h3>4. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to nourish your hair from the inside out. Foods such as salmon, nuts, and leafy greens are great for promoting hair health.</p><h3>5. Get Regular Haircuts</h3><p>Get regular haircuts to prevent split ends and promote healthy hair growth. If you're not comfortable going to a hair salon, consider trimming your hair at home.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>While there is limited information on whether COVID-19 can stay on hair, it's still important to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. By following the tips and hair care advice in this article, you can keep your hair clean and healthy during these challenging times.</p></article>

You’re not alone. Many people have reported hair fall as a side effect of the virus. This condition is known as telogen effluvium, a temporary form of hair loss that can last up to six months after being ill. Here’s what you need to know about what to do when hair is falling out after Covid.</p><h2>What is Telogen Effluvium?</h2><p>Telogen effluvium is a hair loss condition that occurs when the body goes through a stressful event such as a viral infection like Covid-19. The stress of the illness can cause hair to enter the resting phase of the hair growth cycle prematurely, leading to hair shedding. This condition is usually temporary and can be treated with proper care.</p><h2>How to Take Care of Your Hair</h2><p>If you’re experiencing hair loss after Covid-19, there are steps you can take to help your hair recover:</p><h3>1. Be Gentle</h3><p>Avoid harsh hair treatments such as chemical relaxers, hair dyes, and heat styling tools. These can cause further damage to your hair and scalp. Instead, use gentle hair care products and avoid pulling your hair too tightly.</p><h3>2. Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>A balanced diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals is essential for healthy hair growth. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats to nourish your hair from the inside out.</p><h3>3. Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress can exacerbate hair loss, so it’s important to manage stress levels. Try stress-reducing activities such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.</p><h3>4. Get Plenty of Rest</h3><p>Adequate sleep is crucial for overall health, including healthy hair growth. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help your body recover from the stress of Covid-19.</p><h2>FAQ About Hair Loss After Covid-19</h2><h3>How Long Does Hair Loss Last After Covid-19?</h3><p>Hair loss after Covid-19 can last up to six months. However, in most cases, hair growth will resume after the body has fully recovered from the effects of the virus.</p><h3>Is Hair Loss Permanent After Covid-19?</h3><p>No, hair loss after Covid-19 is usually temporary and can be treated with proper hair care and lifestyle changes.</p><h3>When Should I See a Doctor About Hair Loss After Covid-19?</h3><p>If you’re concerned about your hair loss, it’s best to consult with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help determine the underlying cause of your hair loss and recommend appropriate treatment options.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Hair loss after Covid-19 is a common side effect that can be distressing. However, with proper care and lifestyle changes, you can help your hair recover. Be gentle with your hair, eat a balanced diet, manage stress, and get plenty of rest. If you’re concerned about your hair loss, consult with a doctor or dermatologist for further guidance.</p></article>

Suzanne Carillo</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>Maxi dresses are a great way to stay comfortable and fashionable during the warmer months. However, sometimes they can be too short, which can be frustrating. If you find yourself in this situation, don't worry! There are several things you can do to make your maxi dress work for you.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Maxi dresses are long dresses that typically reach the ankles. They are often made of lightweight and flowy fabrics, making them perfect for warm weather. However, if your maxi dress is too short, it can be uncomfortable and unflattering. In this article, we will discuss what you can do to make your maxi dress work for you.</p><h2>How To</h2><h3>Step 1: Add length with a slip or skirt</h3><p>If your maxi dress is only a few inches too short, you can add length by wearing a slip or skirt underneath. Choose a slip or skirt that matches the color and fabric of your dress to create a seamless look. This is a simple and easy way to make your maxi dress work for you.</p><h3>Step 2: Wear leggings or tights</h3><p>If your maxi dress is too short to wear on its own, you can wear leggings or tights underneath. This is a great option if you still want to wear your dress but don't want to show too much skin. Choose a pair of leggings or tights that are the same color as your dress to create a cohesive look.</p><h3>Step 3: Add a belt</h3><p>If your maxi dress is too short, adding a belt can help create the illusion of length. Choose a belt that matches the color of your dress and wear it around your waist. This will help draw the eye upwards and create a longer silhouette.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you make your maxi dress work for you:</p><ul><li>Choose the right shoes - wearing heels or wedges can help elongate your legs and make your dress appear longer.</li><li>Accessorize - adding a statement necklace or earrings can draw attention away from your dress length and towards your face.</li><li>Try a different style - if your maxi dress is too short, try a different style such as a midi or maxi skirt.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I hem my maxi dress?</h3><p>A: Yes, if your maxi dress is too short, you can hem it to make it the right length. However, this may require some sewing skills or a trip to a tailor.</p><h3>Q: Can I wear a maxi dress if I am short?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can still wear a maxi dress if you are short. However, choose a dress that is the right length for your height and wear heels to help elongate your legs.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>When wearing a maxi dress, it's important to consider your hair. If your dress is long and flowy, you may want to wear your hair up to avoid getting it caught in the fabric. Alternatively, you can wear your hair down with a boho-inspired hairstyle such as loose waves or a messy bun.</p><p>In conclusion, if your maxi dress is too short, don't stress! There are several things you can do to make your dress work for you. Whether you choose to add length with a slip or skirt, wear leggings or tights, or add a belt, you can still look stylish and feel comfortable in your maxi dress.</p></article>

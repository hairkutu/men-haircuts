You can go for longer bangs that sweep to the side or shorter bangs that sit just above your eyebrows.</li><li>Layers: Layers can also help to hide a big forehead. By adding layers to your curly hair, you can create volume and movement that distracts from your forehead.</li><li>Updos: Updos can be a great way to pull your hair away from your face and create a more polished look.

After you’ve rinsed out the conditioner, gently squeeze out the excess water from your hair with a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a hair serum or a hair oil.</h3><p>Apply a hair serum or a hair oil to your hair, focusing on the ends and the mid-lengths. These products can help moisturize your hair and tame frizz. Be sure to choose a product that is lightweight and won’t weigh down your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair.</h3><p>Use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to gently comb your hair, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots. This can help prevent breakage and minimize frizz.</p><h3>Step 4: Blow-dry your hair using a diffuser attachment.</h3><p>Attach a diffuser to your blow dryer and use it to dry your hair.

Use a low or medium heat setting and avoid touching your hair with the diffuser too much.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with a hair spray or a hair cream.</h3><p>Apply a hair spray or a hair cream to your hair to help set your style and tame frizz. Choose a product that is lightweight and won’t make your hair look greasy or weighed down.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Frizzy Hair</h2><p>In addition to the tips and how-to steps above, here are some hair care practices that you can incorporate into your routine to help manage frizzy hair:</p><ul><li>Deep condition your hair once a week to help replenish moisture and prevent breakage.</li><li>Avoid using hot styling tools too frequently, or use a heat protectant spray before using them.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to get rid of split ends and promote healthy growth.</li><li>Avoid using hair products that contain sulfates, as they can strip your hair of its natural oils and make it more prone to frizz.</li><li>Avoid using hair elastics that can tug on your hair and cause breakage.

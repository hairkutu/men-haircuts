This can be achieved through various techniques, such as adding layers, bangs, or waves. Here are some hairstyles that work well for long faces:</p><h3>1. Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers can add dimension and movement to your hair, which can help balance out your long face. Ask your stylist to cut long layers that start at your chin or below, as this will draw attention away from your forehead and make your face look more proportionate.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can help shorten your forehead and make your face look less elongated. Ask your stylist to cut your bangs diagonally, so they blend in with the rest of your hair. Avoid straight-across bangs, as these can make your face look even longer.</p><h3>3. Waves and Curls</h3><p>Waves and curls can add volume and width to your hair, which can help balance out your long face. Use a curling iron or hot rollers to add loose waves or curls to your hair. Avoid tight curls, as these can make your face look even longer.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to wear long face:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>Before choosing a hairstyle, it's important to determine your face shape.

But don't worry! With the right cut and styling techniques, you can create a look that complements your face shape and highlights your best features. In this article, we'll show you some of the best hairstyles for oblong face males, along with tips and tricks for getting the perfect look.</p><h2>What is an Oblong Face Shape?</h2><p>An oblong face shape is characterized by a long, narrow shape with a high forehead and a pointy chin. This face shape is longer than it is wide, and can sometimes appear angular or sharp. If you have an oblong face shape, the goal is to create balance and softness with your hairstyle.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Hairstyle for Your Oblong Face Shape</h2><p>When choosing a hairstyle for an oblong face shape, the goal is to make the face appear shorter and more balanced. This can be achieved by adding volume to the sides of the face, creating softness around the jawline, and avoiding styles that elongate the face even further. Here are some tips for choosing the right hairstyle:</p><h3>Short Hairstyles:</h3><p>Short hairstyles can work well for oblong face males, as they can help to balance out the length of the face. A short, textured cut with layers can add volume and movement to the hair, making the face appear fuller and more balanced. Avoid straight, blunt cuts, as these can make the face appear longer.</p><h3>Medium Hairstyles:</h3><p>Medium-length hairstyles can also work well for oblong face males. A layered cut with volume around the sides of the face can create balance and softness, while avoiding styles that are too long or flat.</p><h3>Long Hairstyles:</h3><p>If you prefer longer hairstyles, opt for layers and volume around the sides of the face, which can help to balance out the length. Avoid straight, blunt cuts, and styles that are too long, as these can make the face appear even longer.</p><h2>Top Hairstyles for Oblong Face Male</h2><p>Here are some of the top hairstyles for oblong face males:</p><h3>The Side Part:</h3><p>The side part is a classic, timeless hairstyle that works well for oblong face males. This style creates volume on one side of the head, which helps to balance out the length of the face. To achieve this look, simply part your hair on one side, and use a comb or your fingers to create volume and texture on the opposite side.</p><h3>The Pompadour:</h3><p>The pompadour is a stylish and versatile hairstyle that can work well for oblong face males. This style features short sides and a long, voluminous top, which can help to balance out the length of the face. To achieve this look, use a hair dryer and a round brush to create volume and height on the top of the head.</p><h3>The Messy Quiff:</h3><p>The messy quiff is a cool, modern hairstyle that can work well for oblong face males. This style features a short back and sides, with a long, textured top that can be styled upwards for volume and texture. To achieve this look, use a hair dryer and a styling product to create volume and texture on the top of the head.</p><h2>Tips for Styling Your Hair with an Oblong Face Shape</h2><p>Here are some tips for styling your hair with an oblong face shape:</p><h3>Use Products:</h3><p>Using the right styling products can help to add volume and texture to your hair, which can create balance and softness with an oblong face shape. Use a lightweight mousse or styling cream to add volume and texture to the sides of the head, and a lightweight wax or pomade to add definition and texture to the top of the head.</p><h3>Use a Blow Dryer:</h3><p>Using a blow dryer can help to add volume and texture to your hair, which can create balance and softness with an oblong face shape. Use a round brush to create volume and height on the top of the head, and use your fingers to create texture and definition throughout the hair.</p><h3>Trim Regularly:</h3><p>Regular trims can help to keep your hair looking fresh and healthy, which can make a big difference with an oblong face shape. Visit your stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim, and ask for a cut that adds volume and texture to the sides of the head.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What hairstyles should I avoid with an oblong face shape?</h3><p>Avoid hairstyles that are too long or flat, as these can elongate the face even further. Also avoid straight, blunt cuts, as these can make the face appear longer and sharper.</p><h3>Can I still wear a beard with an oblong face shape?</h3><p>Yes! A beard can help to add balance and softness to an oblong face shape. Opt for a fuller beard, rather than a short, stubbly beard, which can elongate the face even further.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for Oblong Face Male</h2><h3>Wash Regularly:</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly to keep it looking fresh and healthy. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is formulated for your hair type, and avoid using too much product, which can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</p><h3>Use a Heat Protectant:</h3><p>If you use heat styling tools like a blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron, use a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from damage. Apply the spray to damp hair before styling to create a barrier between your hair and the heat.</p><h3>Avoid Over-Brushing:</h3><p>Over-brushing your hair can cause breakage and damage, which can make your hair look dull and lifeless. Use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers to detangle your hair, and avoid brushing it too vigorously.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>If you have an oblong face shape, there are plenty of great hairstyles to choose from. The key is to create balance and softness with your hairstyle, by adding volume to the sides of the face and avoiding styles that elongate the face even further. With the right cut, styling techniques, and hair care routine, you can create a look that flatters your features and highlights your best qualities.</p></article>

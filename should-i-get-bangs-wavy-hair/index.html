If you're considering a hair change, whether it's a big chop, color, or cut, bangs are a great way to switch up your look. However, before diving in, it's important to consider how bangs will work with your hair texture. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about getting bangs with wavy hair, including how to style them and how to care for your new 'do.</p><h2>How To Determine If Bangs Will Work With Your Wavy Hair</h2><p>Before jumping into the world of bangs, it's important to determine if they'll work with your hair texture. Wavy hair can be tricky to work with, as it tends to have a mind of its own. However, the good news is that there are plenty of bang styles that work well with wavy hair. Here are some things to consider when deciding if bangs are right for you:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>The first thing to consider when deciding if bangs will work with your wavy hair is your face shape. While bangs can work with any face shape, certain styles may be more flattering on specific face shapes. For example, if you have a round face, side-swept bangs can help to elongate your face, while blunt bangs may make your face appear shorter and wider.</p><h3>Hair Texture</h3><p>Another thing to consider when deciding if bangs will work with your wavy hair is your hair texture. While wavy hair can work well with bangs, it's important to choose a style that complements your natural texture. For example, if you have thick, coarse waves, heavy blunt bangs may be too much for your hair to handle. Instead, consider softer, side-swept bangs that will blend with your waves.</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>The final thing to consider when deciding if bangs will work with your wavy hair is your lifestyle. Bangs require regular maintenance, so if you're not up for frequent salon visits or daily styling, bangs may not be the best option for you. However, if you're willing to put in the effort, bangs can be a great way to switch up your look.</p><h2>How To Style Bangs With Wavy Hair</h2><p>Once you've decided to take the plunge and get bangs with your wavy hair, the next step is to learn how to style them. Here are some tips for styling bangs with wavy hair:</p><h3>Blow Dry Your Bangs</h3><p>If you have naturally wavy hair, you may find that your bangs don't lay flat when air-dried. To combat this, blow dry your bangs with a round brush to smooth them out and create volume.</p><h3>Use A Curling Iron</h3><p>If you want to add some extra definition to your waves, use a curling iron to curl your bangs away from your face. This will create a flattering, face-framing effect.</p><h3>Avoid Heavy Products</h3><p>When styling your bangs, avoid using heavy products that can weigh them down. Instead, opt for lightweight products, like a texturizing spray or mousse, to add volume and hold without making your bangs look greasy.</p><h2>Step-By-Step Guide To Getting Bangs With Wavy Hair</h2><p>If you've decided that bangs are right for you, here's a step-by-step guide to getting them with your wavy hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Find Inspiration</h3><p>Before heading to the salon, find some inspiration photos of bangs that you like.

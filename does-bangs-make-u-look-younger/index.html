Instead, opt for side-swept bangs that will help elongate your face.</p><p>Next, consider your hair texture. If you have fine hair, you may want to avoid heavy bangs, as they can be difficult to style and may fall flat. Instead, opt for wispy bangs that will add some texture and movement to your hair.</p><p>Finally, think about the style of bangs you want. Do you want blunt bangs that sit straight across your forehead, or do you want side-swept bangs that blend in with the rest of your hair?

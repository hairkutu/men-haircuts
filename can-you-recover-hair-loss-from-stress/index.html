It can lead to various physical and mental health issues, including hair loss. Hair loss can be a major concern for many people, especially when it comes to their appearance.

One of the most common causes is telogen effluvium, a condition in which hair follicles enter a resting phase prematurely due to stress. This can lead to excessive shedding of hair, resulting in noticeable hair thinning or bald patches.</p><p>Another way stress can cause hair loss is by affecting the immune system. Chronic stress can weaken the immune system, leading to autoimmune disorders such as alopecia areata. This condition causes the immune system to attack hair follicles, leading to hair loss.</p><p>Stress can also lead to hormonal imbalances, which can contribute to hair loss. When the body is under stress, it produces more cortisol, a hormone that can affect hair growth cycles. High levels of cortisol can lead to hair thinning or hair loss.</p><h2 id="recovery">Ways to Recover from Hair Loss due to Stress</h2><p>Fortunately, hair loss due to stress is usually temporary and can be recovered from.

First, you want to choose a style that will soften the angles of your face. This can be done by adding layers, side-swept bangs, or waves.</p><p>Another thing to consider is the length of your hair. If you have a square face, you may want to avoid a short bob or pixie cut, as these can accentuate the squareness of your jawline. Instead, opt for longer styles that will add length to your face, such as a shoulder-length cut or a long layered style.</p><p>Lastly, consider your hair type and texture. If you have fine hair, you may want to opt for a blunt cut to add volume. If you have thick hair, layers can help to thin it out and make it more manageable.</p><h2 id="best-haircuts">Best Haircuts for Square Face Older Women</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for when choosing a haircut for your square face, here are some of the best styles for older women:</p><h3>Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers are a great option for square face shapes, as they add length and movement to the hair.

This style works well with both short and long haircuts, and can be customized to suit your individual face shape.</p><h3>Soft Waves</h3><p>Soft waves can be achieved with a curling iron or by simply scrunching your hair with a styling product. This style adds movement and texture to the hair, and can help to soften the angles of a square face.</p><h3>Shoulder-Length Cut</h3><p>A shoulder-length cut is a great option for older women with square faces, as it adds length and draws attention away from the jawline. This style can be worn straight or wavy, and can be customized with layers or bangs.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Getting a Haircut</h2><p>Now that you have chosen the perfect haircut for your square face, here is a step-by-step guide to getting it:</p><ol><li>Find a stylist who specializes in haircuts for square face shapes.</li><li>Show them a picture of the style you want and discuss any modifications that may need to be made to suit your individual face shape.</li><li>Sit back and relax while your stylist works their magic.</li><li>After your haircut, ask your stylist for tips on how to style and maintain your new look.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Haircut</h2><p>Now that you have your new haircut, here are some tips for maintaining it:</p><ul><li>Invest in quality hair products that are designed for your hair type and texture.</li><li>Visit your stylist regularly for trims and touch-ups.</li><li>Experiment with different styling techniques to find what works best for you.</li><li>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before styling.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about haircuts for square face older women:</p><h3>What is the best haircut for a square face?</h3><p>The best haircut for a square face is one that adds length and softens the angles of the jawline.

Your face shape will help you decide which type of bangs will complement your features.</p><p>There are six common face shapes: round, square, heart, oval, diamond, and rectangle. To determine your face shape, pull your hair back and stand in front of a mirror. Use a washable marker or lipstick to trace the outline of your face on the mirror. Stand back and look at the shape you have drawn.</p><p>If your face is round, heart-shaped, or oval, you can usually pull off bangs. If your face is square or rectangular, it may be more difficult to find a bangs style that flatters your features.</p><h2 id="hair-type">Considering Your Hair Type</h2><p>Another factor to consider when deciding if bangs will suit you is your hair type.

If you have a round face, side-swept bangs can help elongate your face. If you have a heart-shaped face, wispy bangs can soften your features.</p><h2 id="face-framing">Framing Your Face with Bangs</h2><p>Another factor to consider when deciding if bangs will suit you is how they will frame your face. Bangs can be used to highlight your best features and draw attention away from areas you may not love.</p><p>For example, if you have a prominent forehead, blunt bangs can help balance out your features. If you have a long face, wispy bangs can help shorten the appearance of your face.</p><h2 id="trying-bangs">Trying Out Bangs without Cutting Your Hair</h2><p>If you are still unsure if bangs will suit you, there are ways to try them out without committing to a haircut.

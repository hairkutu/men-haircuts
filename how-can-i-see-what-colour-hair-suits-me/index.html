Generally, there are three main skin tones: warm, cool, and neutral. Here's how to tell which category you fall into:</p><ul><li><strong>Warm skin tone:</strong> If you have warm undertones, your skin will have a yellow, peachy, or golden hue. You might also have green veins on the underside of your wrist.</li><li><strong>Cool skin tone:</strong> If you have cool undertones, your skin will have a pink, red, or blue-ish hue. You might also have blue veins on the underside of your wrist.</li><li><strong>Neutral skin tone:</strong> If you have neutral undertones, your skin will have a mix of warm and cool hues, or a more muted tone. You might also have both green and blue veins on the underside of your wrist.</li></ul><p>Once you've determined your skin tone, you can start thinking about which hair colours will complement it best.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide for Choosing the Right Hair Colour</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide for figuring out which hair colour will suit you best:</p><ol><li><strong>Determine your skin tone:</strong> Use the tips above to figure out whether you have a warm, cool, or neutral skin tone.</li><li><strong>Consider your eye colour:</strong> Your eye colour can also play a role in determining which hair colour will suit you best. For example, if you have blue eyes, you might look great with a warm, golden blonde hair colour.</li><li><strong>Think about your natural hair colour:</strong> If you're not sure what hair colour will suit you best, consider sticking with a shade that's close to your natural colour. This will help ensure that the colour looks natural and flattering on you.</li><li><strong>Look at your wardrobe:</strong> The colours you wear most often can also give you clues about which hair colour will suit you best. For example, if you tend to wear a lot of warm, earthy tones, you might look great with a warm, caramel brown hair colour.</li><li><strong>Consult a professional:</strong> If you're still not sure which hair colour will suit you best, consider consulting a professional stylist.

For example, if you're used to having dark hair, it might be tough to keep up with a platinum blonde shade.</li><li><strong>Choose a shade that makes you feel confident:</strong> Ultimately, the most important thing is to choose a hair colour that makes you feel confident and beautiful.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about choosing the right hair colour:</p><ul><li><strong>What hair colour looks best on fair skin?</strong> Generally, warm, golden tones like honey blonde, copper, and strawberry blonde look great on fair skin.</li><li><strong>What hair colour looks best on dark skin?</strong> Darker skin tones can look great with rich, warm colours like caramel, chestnut, and auburn.</li><li><strong>Can I dye my hair at home?</strong> While it's possible to dye your hair at home, we recommend consulting a professional stylist for the best results.</li></ul><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Keeping Your New Hair Colour Looking Great</h2><p>Once you've found the perfect hair colour, it's important to take good care of it to keep it looking great.

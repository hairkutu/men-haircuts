Curly hair tends to be dry and prone to breakage, so you'll want to take extra care to keep your curls healthy and hydrated. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Shampoo less often</h3><p>Curly hair tends to be drier than straight hair, so you don't want to strip it of its natural oils by shampooing too often. Aim to wash your hair no more than twice a week, and use a sulfate-free shampoo that won't dry out your curls.</p><h3>2. Condition, condition, condition</h3><p>Conditioner is your friend when you have curly hair. Use a thick, moisturizing conditioner after every shampoo, and consider using a leave-in conditioner as well. This will help to keep your curls soft and hydrated.</p><h3>3. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle</h3><p>Curly hair is prone to tangling, so you'll need to be careful when detangling. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to gently remove tangles, starting at the ends and working your way up.</p><h3>4. Sleep on a silk pillowcase</h3><p>Cotton pillowcases can cause friction and breakage, so consider investing in a silk pillowcase. This will help to keep your curls smooth and frizz-free while you sleep.</p><h2 id="howto">How To Style Short Curly Hair</h2><p>Now that you have a good hair care routine in place, it's time to start styling your curls. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Start with wet hair</h3><p>Curly hair is easiest to style when it's wet, so start by washing and conditioning your hair.</p><h3>2. Apply a styling product</h3><p>Apply a styling product, such as a curl cream or gel, to your wet hair. This will help to define your curls and prevent frizz.</p><h3>3. Use a diffuser</h3><p>A diffuser is a great tool for styling curly hair. Attach it to your blow dryer and use it to dry your curls, using a low heat and speed setting. This will help to keep your curls intact and reduce frizz.</p><h3>4. Finish with a hairspray</h3><p>Once your curls are dry, finish with a light hold hairspray to keep them in place. Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your curls and make them look limp.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step by step guide to styling short curly hair:</p><h3>1. Wash and condition your hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and moisturizing conditioner.</p><h3>2.

Use a diffuser</h3><p>Attach a diffuser to your blow dryer and use it to dry your curls, using a low heat and speed setting.</p><h3>4.

Don't touch your curls too much</h3><p>Touching your curls too much can cause frizz and disrupt their shape, so try to keep your hands off them as much as possible.</p><h3>2. Embrace the messiness</h3><p>Short curly hair is naturally messy and voluminous, so embrace it! Don't try to tame your curls too much, as this can make them look flat and lifeless.</p><h3>3. Experiment with different products</h3><p>Every curly head is different, so it may take some experimentation to find the right products for your hair. Try different curl creams, gels, and mousses until you find the ones that work best for you.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>1.

Can I straighten my short curly hair?</h3><p>You can straighten your short curly hair, but be aware that this can cause damage and breakage. If you do choose to straighten your hair, use a heat protectant and a low heat setting.</p><p>There you have it - our top tips for how to look good with short curly hair.

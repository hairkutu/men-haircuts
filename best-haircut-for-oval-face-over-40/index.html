As we age, our hair changes, and so do our faces. An oval face is considered the most versatile shape, but getting the right haircut can make all the difference. We’ve put together a comprehensive guide to help you find the perfect style for your face shape and age.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>An oval face is longer than it is wide, with a slightly rounded jawline and high cheekbones. This face shape is considered the most versatile because it can pull off almost any haircut. However, as we age, our skin loses elasticity, and our features become less defined. Choosing the right haircut can help to enhance your features and give you a more youthful appearance.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Haircut for Oval Face Over 40</h2><p>When choosing a haircut, it’s essential to consider your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle.

Here are some options:</p><h3>1. Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers can add dimension and movement to a round face. The layers should start at the jawline or below to elongate the face. Avoid blunt cuts that end at the chin as they can make the face look wider.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can create an illusion of length and balance a round face. The bangs should be longer on the sides and gradually get shorter towards the center. Avoid blunt bangs that end at the eyebrows as they can make the face look wider.</p><h3>3. Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut can draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones, making a round face look more angular. The cut should have layers and be slightly longer on top. Avoid cuts that are too short or too long as they can make the face look wider.</p><h3>4. Bob Cut</h3><p>A bob cut can give the illusion of length and balance a round face. The cut should be longer in the front and gradually get shorter towards the back. Avoid blunt cuts that end at the chin as they can make the face look wider.</p><h3>5.

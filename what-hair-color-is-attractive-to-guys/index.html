If you have warm undertones, you should opt for warm hair colors such as golden blonde, caramel brown, and copper red. If you have cool undertones, you should choose cool hair colors such as ashy blonde, platinum blonde, and jet black.</p><p>You should also consider your eye color when choosing a hair color. If you have blue or green eyes, you can opt for blonde or light brown hair. If you have brown eyes, you can choose darker hair colors such as brown or black.</p><p>Lastly, you should consider your natural hair color. If you have dark hair, you may want to lighten it gradually to avoid damaging your hair.

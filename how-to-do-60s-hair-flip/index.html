This iconic look is all about volume and movement, giving your hair a playful bounce that's perfect for parties, weddings or even a night out with friends. In this article, we'll show you how to do 60s hair flip in just a few easy steps.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 60s hair flip is a classic hairstyle that's all about big hair with lots of volume and bounce. It's a playful and flirty look that's perfect for any occasion, from a night out with friends to a wedding or special event. The key to achieving this look is to create lots of volume at the crown of your head, and then flip your hair outwards at the ends. </p><h2>How to Do 60s Hair Flip</h2><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>The first step to creating the 60s hair flip is to start with clean, dry hair. This will help your hair to hold its shape and give you the best results. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you may want to straighten it first to make it easier to work with.</p><h3>Step 2: Use a volumizing product</h3><p>To add volume to your hair, use a volumizing product such as mousse, root lift spray or dry shampoo. Apply the product to the roots of your hair and work it in with your fingers, then blow dry your hair upside down using a round brush to add more volume.</p><h3>Step 3: Tease your hair</h3><p>To create even more volume, tease your hair at the crown. Take a small section of hair and backcomb it towards your scalp using a fine-toothed comb. Repeat this process on several sections of hair, then smooth the top layer of hair over the teased sections to create a smooth finish.</p><h3>Step 4: Flip out the ends</h3><p>The final step is to flip out the ends of your hair. To do this, use a round brush to curl the ends of your hair outwards as you blow dry. You can also use a curling iron or flat iron to create more defined curls or waves.</p><h2>Tips for Perfecting the 60s Hair Flip</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get the perfect 60s hair flip:</p><ul><li>Use a small amount of hairspray to hold your hair in place.</li><li>Don't be afraid to tease your hair – the more volume, the better!</li><li>Use a round brush to curl your hair outwards at the ends.</li><li>For a more defined look, use a curling iron or flat iron to create tighter curls or waves.</li></ul><h2>FAQs About the 60s Hair Flip</h2><h3>What kind of hair works best for the 60s hair flip?</h3><p>The 60s hair flip works best on medium to long hair that's straight or has a slight wave. If your hair is naturally curly or very thick, you may need to straighten it first to make it easier to work with.</p><h3>Can I do the 60s hair flip with a shorter haircut?</h3><p>The 60s hair flip is best suited for medium to long hair, but you can still achieve a similar look with a shorter haircut. Use a curling iron or flat iron to curl the ends of your hair outwards, and add volume at the crown using a volumizing product and teasing.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for Maintaining Your 60s Hair Flip</h2><p>To keep your 60s hair flip looking its best, here are some hair care tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every other day to avoid stripping it of natural oils.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using heat styling tools.</li><li>Regularly trim your hair to prevent split ends and maintain the shape of your 60s hair flip.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The 60s hair flip is a classic hairstyle that's perfect for adding some retro flair to your look.

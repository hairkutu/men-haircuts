Your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, and your forehead and jawline are both narrow. Although this face shape is considered to be the most versatile, it can be challenging to find the right hairstyles and makeup looks that flatter your features. If you're struggling to find the right style for your diamond face shape, keep reading for our tips and tricks.</p><h2>Description of Diamond Face Shape</h2><p>Before we get into the styling tips, let's go over the characteristics of a diamond face shape. As we mentioned earlier, the widest part of your face is your cheekbones, and your forehead and jawline are both narrow. Your face is also longer than it is wide, and you have a pointed chin. Some celebrities with diamond face shapes include Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, and Scarlett Johansson.</p><h2>How to Style Diamond Face Shape</h2><h3>1. Choose the Right Haircut</h3><p>When it comes to hairstyles for diamond-shaped faces, you want to choose styles that balance out your features. You can achieve this by adding volume to the top of your head or creating width at the jawline. Some great haircut options for diamond face shapes include long layers, side-swept bangs, and bob haircuts. Avoid hairstyles that are too short or too long, as they can make your face appear longer.</p><h3>2. Experiment with Parting Your Hair</h3><p>The way you part your hair can also make a significant difference in how your face appears. If you have a diamond face shape, you can try a middle part or a deep side part to create balance. Avoid a center part if you have a long face because it can make your face appear even longer.</p><h3>3. Highlight Your Cheekbones</h3><p>Since your cheekbones are the most prominent feature of your face, you want to make sure they stand out. You can achieve this by using a highlighter on the tops of your cheekbones to create a glowing effect. You can also use a darker shade of blush to contour the hollows of your cheeks and make your cheekbones pop even more.</p><h3>4. Play with Eye Makeup</h3><p>When it comes to eye makeup for diamond face shapes, you want to draw attention to your eyes without overwhelming your face. You can achieve this by using neutral shades on your lids and adding a pop of color to your lower lash line. You can also try winged eyeliner to create a cat-eye effect that elongates your eyes.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Styling Diamond Face Shape</h2><p>Now that you know the basic tips for styling a diamond face shape, let's go over a step-by-step guide.</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>Before you start styling your hair and makeup, you need to determine your face shape. If you're unsure, you can use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Haircut</h3><p>Based on your diamond face shape, choose a haircut that flatters your features. You can consult with a hairstylist to find the perfect style for you.</p><h3>Step 3: Experiment with Parting Your Hair</h3><p>Try different parting styles to find the one that balances your features the best.</p><h3>Step 4: Highlight Your Cheekbones</h3><p>Use a highlighter and contouring powder to make your cheekbones stand out.</p><h3>Step 5: Play with Eye Makeup</h3><p>Experiment with different eye makeup styles to find the one that makes your eyes stand out without overwhelming your face.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Healthy Hair</h2><p>Now that you know how to style your diamond face shape, it's essential to maintain healthy hair. Here are some tips for keeping your hair in top shape:</p><h3>1. Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Look for a shampoo that's gentle on your hair and doesn't strip away natural oils.</p><h3>2. Condition Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Use a deep conditioner once a week to keep your hair hydrated and nourished.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair from Heat</h3><p>Avoid using hot tools too often, and always use a heat protectant spray when styling with heat.</p><h3>4. Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Visit the salon every six to eight weeks to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What hairstyles are best for diamond face shapes?</h3><p>Hairstyles that add volume to the top of your head or create width at the jawline are best for diamond face shapes. Examples include long layers, side-swept bangs, and bob haircuts.</p><h3>How do I highlight my cheekbones?</h3><p>Use a highlighter on the tops of your cheekbones to create a glowing effect.

During pregnancy, hormones cause the hair to remain in the growth phase, resulting in fuller and thicker hair. After delivery, the hormones drop, and the hair enters the resting phase, leading to hair fall. The hair fall can start a few weeks after delivery and can last up to six months. The hair loss can be more pronounced if you had a C-section or experienced a lot of stress during and after delivery.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Stop Hair Fall Postpartum</h2><p>Here are some ways to minimize hair fall and promote hair growth postpartum:</p><h3>Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote hair growth.

Leafy greens, eggs, nuts, and berries are great options to add to your diet.</p><h3>Reduce Stress</h3><p>Stress can contribute to hair fall, so it's essential to take care of your mental health. Engage in activities that promote relaxation, such as yoga or meditation. Also, try to get enough sleep and take breaks whenever possible.</p><h3>Use Gentle Hair Care Products</h3><p>Use gentle hair care products that do not contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair. Avoid using hot tools like curling irons and hair dryers, as they can cause hair breakage.

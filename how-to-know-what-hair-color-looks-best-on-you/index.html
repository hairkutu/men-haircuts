If you have warm skin tones, you should choose hair colors that have golden or caramel undertones. If you have cool skin tones, you should choose hair colors that have ashy or cool undertones. If you have neutral skin tones, you can choose hair colors that have warm or cool undertones.</p><h3>2. Consider Your Eye Color</h3><p>Your eye color can also help you determine your best hair color.

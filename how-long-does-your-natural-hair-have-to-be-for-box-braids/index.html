It's important to wash and condition your hair before getting box braids. This will help ensure that your scalp is clean and healthy, and that your hair is easy to work with.</li><li>Part your hair into small, square-shaped sections. The size of the sections will depend on the thickness and length of your hair, as well as your personal preference.</li><li>Braid each section of hair tightly from the root to the end. It's important to braid your hair tightly to ensure that the braids will stay in place and last for a long time.</li><li>If you're using hair extensions, attach them to the end of each braid. You can use synthetic or human hair extensions, depending on your preference and budget.</li><li>Continue braiding and attaching extensions until your entire head is covered in box braids.</li><li>Style your braids as desired. You can wear your box braids straight, curly, or in a bun or ponytail.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips for Caring for Your Hair While Wearing Box Braids</h3><p>While box braids are a great protective hairstyle, it's important to take care of your hair while wearing them.

Here are some hair care tips to consider:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly using a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools such as curling irons and flat irons too often.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV-protectant spray.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends and breakage.</li><li>Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote healthy hair growth.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, cutting your hair shorter may make it curlier, but the results depend on various factors.

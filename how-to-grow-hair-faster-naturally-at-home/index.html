Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>Your hair needs essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to grow and thrive. Make sure to incorporate foods that are rich in protein, iron, zinc, and biotin into your diet. Some examples include eggs, nuts, leafy greens, and avocados.</p><h3>2.

You can also use essential oils like peppermint or lavender to enhance the massage.</p><h3>3. Use Natural Hair Masks</h3><p>Natural hair masks can nourish your hair and promote growth. Some popular ingredients for hair masks include coconut oil, honey, and aloe vera. Apply the mask to your hair and leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing it off.</p><h3>4. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools can damage your hair and slow down the growth process.

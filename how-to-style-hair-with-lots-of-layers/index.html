Start at the mid-lengths of your hair and wrap sections of hair around the barrel, holding for a few seconds before releasing.</li><li>If you want a sleek, polished look, use a straightening iron to smooth out your hair. Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends, using a comb to help guide the iron through your hair.</li><li>To finish your style, apply a light-hold hairspray or a shine serum to add texture and shine.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you're looking for a more detailed guide to styling your layered hair, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Shampoo and condition your hair.

Layered hair is versatile and can be styled in many different ways.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some common questions about styling and caring for layered hair:</p><h3>Q: How often should I get my layered hair trimmed?</h3><p>A: It's generally recommended to get your hair trimmed every 6-8 weeks to keep your layers looking fresh and prevent split ends.</p><h3>Q: Can I still wear my hair in a ponytail or bun if I have lots of layers?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can still wear your hair in a ponytail or bun if you have lots of layers.

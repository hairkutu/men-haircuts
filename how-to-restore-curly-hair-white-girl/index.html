This will help you choose the right products and styling techniques for your hair. There are generally four types of curly hair:</p><h3>Type 2: Wavy Hair</h3><p>Wavy hair has a loose S-shaped pattern and is prone to frizz. It's the easiest type of curly hair to style and manage.</p><h3>Type 3: Curly Hair</h3><p>Curly hair has a tighter S-shaped pattern and can be prone to dryness and frizz. It requires more moisture and gentle handling to maintain its shape.</p><h3>Type 4: Coily Hair</h3><p>Coily hair has a tight, springy curl pattern and is prone to dryness and breakage. It requires the most moisture and gentle handling to prevent damage.</p><h3>Type 4a: Tightly Coiled Hair</h3><p>Tightly coiled hair has a small, springy curl pattern and is the most fragile type of curly hair.

Follow these tips:</p><h3>Tip 1: Apply conditioner to the ends of your hair.</h3><p>Apply conditioner to the ends of your hair first, as this is where your hair is most damaged and dry. Work the conditioner up to your roots, but don't apply it to your scalp.</p><h3>Tip 2: Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair.</h3><p>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair while the conditioner is still in your hair.

Follow these tips:</p><h3>Tip 1: Apply deep conditioner to your hair.</h3><p>Apply deep conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends. If your hair is very dry, you can apply deep conditioner to your entire head.</p><h3>Tip 2: Cover your hair with a plastic cap.</h3><p>Cover your hair with a plastic cap and let the deep conditioner sit for 30 minutes to an hour.

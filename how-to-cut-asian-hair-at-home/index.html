Use clips to divide your hair into four or more sections, depending on the thickness of your hair.</li><li>Start with the back. Use a mirror to see the back of your head. Lift a section of hair and cut it straight across, using the bottom of the previous section as a guide.</li><li>Move to the sides. Take a section of hair from the sides and hold it between your fingers. Cut the hair at an angle, using the previous section as a guide.</li><li>Cut the bangs. If you have bangs, separate them from the rest of your hair. Cut them straight across or at an angle, depending on your preference.</li><li>Check for symmetry. Use two mirrors to check if your hair is symmetrical. If not, trim the longer side to match the shorter side.</li><li>Blend the layers. Use scissors to blend the layers together, so your hair looks natural and not choppy.</li><li>Trim the ends. Check for split ends and trim them off.

Follow the same steps, but keep in mind that curly hair tends to bounce up when it's dry, so cut it a little longer than you want it to be. <strong>Q: How often should I cut my hair?</strong><br/>A: It depends on your hair type and how fast it grows. Generally, it's recommended to cut your hair every six to eight weeks. <strong>Q: What should I do if I make a mistake?</strong><br/>A: Don't panic. Mistakes happen, and hair grows back. If you make a mistake, try to fix it by trimming the other side to match. If it's a big mistake, you can always go to a salon to get it fixed.</p><h3 id="hair-care">Hair Care After Cutting</h3><p>After cutting your hair, it's important to take good care of it to keep it healthy and shiny.

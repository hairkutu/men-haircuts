A lot of guys have different preferences when it comes to hair, but there are some hairstyles that are universally flattering. In this article, we will take a look at the top hairstyles that guys like and how you can achieve them. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ol><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>There are many different hairstyles that guys like on women. Some guys prefer long hair, while others like short hair. Some guys like curly hair, while others like straight hair. It really depends on the guy and their personal preference. However, there are a few hairstyles that are universally attractive to guys. These include:</p><ul><li>Long hair with loose waves</li><li>A messy bun</li><li>A high ponytail</li><li>Straight hair with a center part</li><li>A bob haircut</li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The good news is that achieving these hairstyles is relatively easy. For long hair with loose waves, all you need is a curling iron and some hairspray. Start by curling small sections of your hair, then brush through the curls with your fingers to create loose waves. Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><p>To create a messy bun, start by pulling your hair back into a high ponytail. Twist the ponytail around itself to create a bun, then secure with bobby pins. Pull a few strands of hair out of the bun to create a messy, effortless look.</p><p>A high ponytail is another easy style to achieve. Simply pull your hair back into a high ponytail, securing with an elastic. To add some volume, tease the hair at the crown of your head before pulling it back.</p><p>Straight hair with a center part is a classic, timeless look. To achieve this style, simply straighten your hair with a flat iron and part it down the middle. Finish with a spritz of shine spray to add some gloss.</p><p>A bob haircut is another universally flattering style. Whether you opt for a classic bob or a more modern, textured bob, this style is sure to turn heads. To maintain your bob, make sure to get regular trims and use a texturizing spray to add volume and movement.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>Here are step-by-step instructions for achieving each of these hairstyles:</p><h3>Long hair with loose waves</h3><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair</li><li>Section your hair into small sections</li><li>Using a curling iron, curl each section of hair away from your face</li><li>Once all sections are curled, brush through the curls with your fingers to create loose waves</li><li>Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place</li></ol><h3>A messy bun</h3><ol><li>Start by pulling your hair back into a high ponytail</li><li>Twist the ponytail around itself to create a bun</li><li>Secure the bun with bobby pins</li><li>Pull a few strands of hair out of the bun to create a messy, effortless look</li><li>Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place</li></ol><h3>A high ponytail</h3><ol><li>Start by teasing the hair at the crown of your head to add volume</li><li>Pull your hair back into a high ponytail, securing with an elastic</li><li>Smooth down any flyaways with a bit of hairspray</li><li>Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place</li></ol><h3>Straight hair with a center part</h3><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair</li><li>Straighten your hair with a flat iron</li><li>Part your hair down the middle with a comb</li><li>Finish with a spritz of shine spray to add some gloss</li></ol><h3>A bob haircut</h3><ol><li>Make sure to get regular trims to maintain your bob</li><li>Use a texturizing spray to add volume and movement to your hair</li><li>Style your bob with a flat iron or curling iron for added texture</li><li>Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are a few tips for achieving the perfect hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Invest in quality hair tools, like a good curling iron or flat iron</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before styling your hair with heat tools</li><li>Experiment with different hair products, like texturizing sprays and shine sprays</li><li>Don't be afraid to ask your hairstylist for advice on which style would look best on you</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about what hairstyles do guys like Reddit:</p><h3>What hairstyles do guys like on short hair?</h3><p>Guys tend to like short hair that is styled in a modern, edgy way.

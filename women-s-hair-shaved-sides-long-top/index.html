Do you want to stand out and make a statement? If so, the women's hair shaved sides long top trend may be just what you need. This bold and beautiful hairstyle has been gaining popularity in recent years, and for good reason. Not only does it look amazing, but it is also versatile and easy to maintain. In this article, we will take a closer look at this trend and provide you with all the information you need to rock this look with confidence.</p><h2>What is the Women's Hair Shaved Sides Long Top Hairstyle?</h2><p>The women's hair shaved sides long top hairstyle is a bold and edgy look that involves shaving the sides of your head while leaving the hair on top long. The length of the hair on top can vary, but it is typically kept longer than the shaved sides. This creates a dramatic contrast between the two sections of hair and gives the hairstyle its signature look.</p><h3>How to Achieve the Women's Hair Shaved Sides Long Top Hairstyle</h3><p>If you are interested in trying out this hairstyle, there are a few steps you will need to follow:</p><ol><li>Decide on the length of your hair on top. This will determine how much hair you will need to leave unshaved.</li><li>Choose the right clippers. You will need a set of clippers with guard sizes that will allow you to shave the sides of your head to the desired length.</li><li>Section off the hair on top. Use hair clips to separate the hair on top from the hair on the sides.</li><li>Start shaving the sides. Use the clippers to shave the sides of your head, starting with the largest guard size and working your way down to the smallest.</li><li>Blend the shaved sides with the hair on top. Use scissors or a razor to create a seamless transition between the shaved sides and the longer hair on top.</li><li>Style your hair on top. You can style the hair on top however you like, whether it's straight, curly, or something in between.</li></ol><h3>Tips for Maintaining the Women's Hair Shaved Sides Long Top Hairstyle</h3><p>Once you have achieved the women's hair shaved sides long top hairstyle, it is important to take care of it properly. Here are some tips for maintaining this edgy look:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims. Even though the hair on top is longer, it still needs to be trimmed regularly to keep it looking neat and healthy.</li><li>Use the right products. Depending on your hair type, you may need to use specific products to keep your hair looking its best. Consult with your hairstylist for recommendations.</li><li>Consider getting touch-ups. As your hair grows, you may need to get touch-ups to maintain the shaved sides. This will help keep the contrast between the two sections of hair sharp.</li></ul><h3>FAQs About the Women's Hair Shaved Sides Long Top Hairstyle</h3><p>Here are some commonly asked questions about this bold and beautiful hairstyle trend:</p><ol><li>Is the women's hair shaved sides long top hairstyle suitable for all hair types?</li><p>Yes, this hairstyle can be adapted to suit a variety of hair types, from straight to curly to textured.</p><li>Is this hairstyle easy to maintain?</li><p>Yes, this hairstyle is relatively easy to maintain, especially if you keep the hair on top long enough to tie back or style in different ways.</p><li>Can I still wear my hair up with this hairstyle?</li><p>Yes, you can still wear your hair up with this hairstyle. You may need to use additional styling products or accessories to keep the shaved sides in place, but it is definitely possible.</p></ol><h3>How to Take Care of Your Hair After Shaving It</h3><p>After shaving your hair, it's important to take good care of it to keep it healthy and looking great. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Moisturize your scalp. Shaving can leave your scalp dry and itchy, so be sure to moisturize it regularly with a scalp oil or conditioner.</li><li>Protect your scalp from the sun. Since your scalp is now exposed to the sun, it's important to protect it with a hat or sunscreen.</li><li>Be gentle when styling your hair. Since your hair is shorter, it may be more prone to breakage. Be gentle when brushing or styling it to avoid causing damage.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The women's hair shaved sides long top hairstyle is a bold and beautiful trend that is perfect for anyone who wants to stand out and make a statement. With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve this edgy look and maintain it with ease. Just remember to take good care of your hair and scalp, and you'll be rocking this trend like a pro in no time.</p></article>

You're in luck! In this article, we'll go over how to style wet hair to be curly. From the tools you need to the step-by-step process, we've got you covered. Let's get started!</p><h2>How To</h2><p>The first step in styling wet hair to be curly is to make sure your hair is completely wet. You can do this by jumping in the shower or using a spray bottle filled with water. Once your hair is wet, apply a curl-enhancing product throughout your hair.

Take a small section of hair and apply a styling gel or mousse. Make sure to evenly distribute the product throughout the section of hair.</p><p>Using a curling wand or curling iron, wrap the section of hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for a few seconds, then release. Repeat this process for all sections of hair.</p><p>Once all sections of hair are curled, scrunch your hair with your hands. This will help to loosen the curls and give them a more natural look. Allow your hair to air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. </p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Wet Your Hair</h3><p>Make sure your hair is completely wet.

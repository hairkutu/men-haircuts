This style is great for those who want a bold, edgy look.</p><h3>Temp Fade</h3><p>A temp fade, also known as a temple fade, is a subtle fade that starts at the temples and fades into the rest of the hair. This style is great for guys who want a low-maintenance haircut that's still stylish.</p><h3>Bald Fade</h3><p>A bald fade, also known as a skin fade, is a dramatic fade that goes from a longer length on top to a shaved head. This style is great for those who want a bold, edgy look.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Get a Fade Haircut</h2><p>If you're looking to get a fade haircut, it's best to visit a professional barber.

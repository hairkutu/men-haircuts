Here&#039;s The Answer The Everygirl</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>Have you noticed that your once curly hair is now growing straight? If so, you're not alone. Many people experience changes in their hair texture over time. In this article, we'll explore some of the reasons why your hair may no longer be growing curly and what you can do about it.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Curly hair is caused by a particular shape of hair follicles. When the follicles are oval-shaped, hair grows in a curly pattern. When they are round, hair grows straight. Genetics play a significant role in determining the shape of hair follicles, which is why curly hair tends to run in families.</p><p>However, other factors can influence the shape of hair follicles and, as a result, the texture of your hair. These factors can include hormonal changes, heat damage, and chemical treatments.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're looking to restore your hair's natural curl pattern, there are several things you can try:</p><h3>1. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Excessive heat can damage the hair shaft and alter the texture of your hair. Try to avoid heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons, and opt for air-drying your hair or using heat-free styling methods instead.</p><h3>2. Use Hair Products Specifically Designed for Curly Hair</h3><p>There are many hair products on the market that are specifically designed for curly hair. These products can help to enhance your natural curl pattern and keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</p><h3>3. Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Split ends and damaged hair can prevent your hair from curling properly. Regular trims can help to keep your hair healthy and promote curl formation.</p><h3>4. Limit Chemical Treatments</h3><p>Chemical treatments, such as relaxers and perms, can permanently alter the texture of your hair. If you're looking to restore your natural curl pattern, it's best to avoid these treatments altogether.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Identify the Cause</h3><p>The first step in restoring your natural curl pattern is to identify the cause of the change in your hair texture. Was it the result of a chemical treatment or heat damage? Identifying the cause can help you determine the best course of action.</p><h3>Step 2: Adopt Healthy Hair Habits</h3><p>The next step is to adopt healthy hair habits that can help to promote curl formation. This can include using hair products specifically designed for curly hair, avoiding heat styling tools, and getting regular trims.</p><h3>Step 3: Be Patient</h3><p>Restoring your natural curl pattern can take time. Be patient and consistent with your hair care routine, and you'll eventually start to see results.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for restoring your natural curl pattern:</p> - Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair gently. - Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause frizz and breakage. - Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair hydrated. - Sleep on a satin pillowcase to prevent friction and breakage. <h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can stress cause my hair to stop growing curly?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can impact your hair's texture and growth patterns. Stress can cause hormonal imbalances, which can, in turn, affect the shape of your hair follicles.</p><h3>Q: Can I restore my natural curl pattern if I've had a relaxer?</h3><p>A: It's possible to restore your natural curl pattern after having a relaxer, but it can be a lengthy process. You'll need to grow out the relaxer and adopt healthy hair habits to promote curl formation.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Remember, healthy hair starts with a healthy scalp. Be sure to eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and get plenty of sleep to promote healthy hair growth. With patience and dedication, you can restore your natural curl pattern and enjoy luscious, bouncy curls once again.</p></article>

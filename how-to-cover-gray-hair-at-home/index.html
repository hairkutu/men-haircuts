Use hair clips to keep each section separate.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply the Hair Color</h3><p>Starting with the back section, use the applicator brush to apply the hair color to your roots. Work your way towards the front, making sure to cover all the gray hair. Be sure to apply the hair color evenly, and avoid applying too much color, as this can cause damage to your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Wait</h3><p>Leave the hair color on for the recommended amount of time. This will vary depending on the brand of hair color you're using, but it's usually around 30 minutes.</p><h3>Step 5: Rinse</h3><p>Rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water until the water runs clear.

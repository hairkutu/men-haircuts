Not only does it keep your hair out of your face, but it also helps to retain moisture and prevent breakage. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of doing big twist on natural hair, from preparation to maintenance. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ol><li> How to Prepare Your Hair </li><li> How to Section Your Hair </li><li> How to Apply Product </li><li> How to Twist Your Hair </li><li> How to Dry Your Hair </li><li> How to Take Down Your Twists </li><li> Tips for Maintaining Your Twists </li><li> Frequently Asked Questions </li><li> Hair Care for Natural Hair </li></ol><h2> How to Prepare Your Hair </h2><p> Before you start twisting your hair, it's important to make sure that your hair is clean, moisturized, and detangled. Here's how to prepare your hair: </p><ul><li> Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo. </li><li> Follow up with a deep conditioning treatment to add moisture to your hair. </li><li> After rinsing out the deep conditioner, apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair to further moisturize it. </li><li> Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots. </li><li> Divide your hair into sections that are about the same size as the twists you want to create. </li></ul><h2> How to Section Your Hair </h2><p> Sectioning your hair is an important step in the twisting process because it helps you to create neat and even twists. Here's how to section your hair: </p><ul><li> Use a rat-tail comb to create a part down the center of your hair, from your forehead to the nape of your neck. </li><li> Create a horizontal part from ear to ear, dividing your hair into two sections. </li><li> Clip up the top section of your hair and work on the bottom section first. </li><li> Create smaller parts within the bottom section, depending on how big you want your twists to be. </li><li> Twist each smaller section tightly, making sure to keep the twists neat and even. </li><li> Repeat the process on the top section of your hair. </li></ul><h2> How to Apply Product </h2><p> Applying product to your hair before twisting helps to keep the twists in place and prevent frizz. Here's how to apply product: </p><ul><li> Use a moisturizing cream, gel, or butter to coat each section of your hair. </li><li> Make sure to apply the product evenly, from the roots to the ends of your hair. </li><li> Use a comb or your fingers to distribute the product evenly throughout each section. </li></ul><h2> How to Twist Your Hair </h2><p> Now that you've prepared your hair and applied product, it's time to start twisting. Here's how to twist your hair: </p><ul><li> Take a small section of hair and divide it into two equal parts. </li><li> Twist the two sections of hair around each other, making sure to keep the twists tight and even. </li><li> Continue twisting each section of hair until you reach the ends. </li><li> Secure each twist with a small hair tie or bobby pin. </li><li> Repeat the process on each section of hair until your entire head is twisted. </li></ul><h2> How to Dry Your Hair </h2><p> Drying your hair properly is important to prevent frizz and ensure that your twists set properly. Here's how to dry your hair: </p><ul><li> If you have time, let your hair air dry by sitting under a hooded dryer or using a diffuser attachment on a blow dryer. </li><li> If you're in a hurry, you can use a hair dryer on low heat to speed up the drying process. </li><li> Make sure to avoid touching your twists while they're drying to prevent frizz. </li></ul><h2> How to Take Down Your Twists </h2><p> After your twists are completely dry, it's time to take them down. Here's how to take down your twists: </p><ul><li> Carefully remove the hair ties or bobby pins from each twist. </li><li> Use your fingers to gently separate each twist, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots. </li><li> Once all of your twists are separated, use a pick or wide-tooth comb to fluff out your hair and create volume. </li></ul><h2> Tips for Maintaining Your Twists </h2><p> To ensure that your twists last as long as possible, it's important to take good care of them. Here are some tips for maintaining your twists: </p><ul><li> Sleep with a satin or silk bonnet or pillowcase to prevent frizz. </li><li> Moisturize your hair regularly with a leave-in conditioner or hair oil. </li><li> Avoid using heavy oils or products that can weigh down your hair. </li><li> Use a scarf or headband to keep your twists out of your face when exercising or doing other activities. </li></ul><h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2><h3> How long do big twist on natural hair typically last? </h3><p> Big twist on natural hair can last anywhere from one to four weeks, depending on how well you maintain them. </p><h3> Can you do big twist on natural hair on short hair? </h3><p> Yes, you can do big twist on natural hair on short hair. You may need to create smaller sections to ensure that the twists are even and neat. </p><h3> Can you wash your hair while it's in big twist? </h3><p> Yes, you can wash your hair while it's in big twist.

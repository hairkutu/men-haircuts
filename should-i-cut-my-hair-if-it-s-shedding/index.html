Lewigs</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>Are you experiencing hair shedding and wondering if you should cut your hair? Hair shedding is a natural process, and it happens to everyone. However, excessive shedding can be a concern for some people. In this article, we will discuss if cutting your hair is the solution to excessive hair shedding.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Hair shedding is the natural process of losing hair. On average, people shed between 50 to 100 hairs per day. Shedding can be caused by various reasons, such as hormonal changes, stress, medication, and genetics. In some cases, excessive shedding can lead to thinning hair and baldness.</p><h2>How to Determine Excessive Hair Shedding?</h2><p>It is normal to lose hair every day; however, if you are losing more than 100 hairs per day, you may have excessive hair shedding. To determine if you have excessive hair shedding, you can perform a hair pull test. To do this, gently pull a small section of hair from different parts of your scalp. If you have more than six hairs in your hand, you may have excessive hair shedding.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Cutting Your Hair</h2><p>If you have determined that you have excessive hair shedding, cutting your hair may be an option. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to cut your hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Decide on a Style</h3><p>Before cutting your hair, decide on a style that you want. You can consult with a hairstylist to help you choose a style that will suit your face shape and lifestyle.</p><h3>Step 2: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>You will need a pair of scissors, a comb, and hair clips to cut your hair. Make sure that your scissors are sharp, and your tools are clean.</p><h3>Step 3: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before cutting it. This will make it easier to cut and style.</p><h3>Step 4: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into manageable parts using hair clips. This will make it easier to cut your hair evenly.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut Your Hair</h3><p>Starting from the back of your head, use your scissors to cut your hair according to your desired style. Cut small sections at a time and check for evenness.</p><h3>Step 6: Style Your Hair</h3><p>After cutting your hair, style it according to your preference. You can use a blow dryer, curling iron, or flat iron to style your hair.</p><h2>Tips to Prevent Hair Shedding</h2><p>Here are some tips to prevent hair shedding:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals</li><li>Avoid tight hairstyles that can pull on your hair</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools frequently</li><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Will cutting my hair reduce shedding?</h3><p>A: Cutting your hair will not reduce shedding. However, it can help to prevent further damage to your hair.</p><h3>Q: How long does hair shedding last?</h3><p>A: Hair shedding can last from a few weeks to a few months. However, if shedding persists, it is best to consult with a doctor or dermatologist.</p><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair shedding?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can cause hair shedding.

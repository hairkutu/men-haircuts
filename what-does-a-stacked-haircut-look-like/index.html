A stacked haircut may be just what you need. This trendy cut has been popular for years and looks great on all hair types. In this article, we'll cover everything you need to know about what a stacked haircut looks like, how to get it, and how to care for it.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A stacked haircut is a layered cut that creates volume and movement in your hair. The layers are cut shorter in the back and gradually get longer towards the front. This creates a "stacked" effect that adds dimension and texture to your hair. The back of the hair is usually cut to just below the nape of the neck, while the front can be cut to chin length or longer.</p><p>The stacked haircut is also known as an inverted bob, as the hair is shorter in the back and longer in the front. It's a versatile style that can be worn straight, curled, or in loose waves.</p><h2>How to Get a Stacked Haircut</h2><p>If you're interested in getting a stacked haircut, it's important to find a hairstylist who has experience with this style. They will be able to create the perfect layers and angles to suit your face shape and hair type.</p><p>During your appointment, your stylist will start by washing and drying your hair. They will then section your hair and cut the layers at an angle, creating the stacked effect. Once the cut is complete, they may add some additional layers or texture using thinning shears or a razor.</p><p>After your haircut, your stylist may recommend some styling products to help you recreate the look at home. These could include volumizing mousse, texturizing spray, or a heat protectant spray if you plan to use heat styling tools.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get a stacked haircut:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose a hairstylist</h3><p>Find a hairstylist who has experience with stacked haircuts.

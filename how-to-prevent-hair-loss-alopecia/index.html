Androgenetic alopecia is the most common type of alopecia, which is caused by genetics. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. Telogen effluvium is caused by stress or hormonal changes, while scarring alopecia is caused by inflammation that damages hair follicles. </p><h2>How to Prevent Alopecia</h2><p> There are different ways to prevent alopecia, depending on the type and cause of hair loss. Here are some ways to prevent alopecia: </p><h3>1. Maintain a Healthy Diet</h3><p> A healthy diet is essential for healthy hair growth.

Treat Medical Conditions</h3><p> If you have a medical condition that causes hair loss, such as thyroid problems or autoimmune diseases, get proper treatment. </p><h3>5.

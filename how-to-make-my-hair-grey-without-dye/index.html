Try a vinegar rinse</h3><p>A vinegar rinse can help to remove any product buildup and restore the natural pH balance of your scalp. To make a vinegar rinse, mix equal parts water and apple cider vinegar and apply it to your hair after shampooing. Leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it out with cool water.</p><h3>4.

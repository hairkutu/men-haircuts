You can blow dry your hair or let it air dry, depending on your preference. Once your hair is dry, you can follow the steps below:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by applying a heat protectant spray to your hair. This will protect your hair from damage caused by heat styling tools. You can also apply some styling mousse to add volume to your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Create the Parting</h3><p>To create the curtain bangs, you need to create a middle parting. Use a comb to create a straight line down the middle of your head.

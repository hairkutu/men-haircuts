You also want a mousse that will provide a good hold without feeling sticky or crunchy. Look for mousses with volumizing ingredients such as keratin, collagen, or biotin.</p><p>Here are some of the best mousse for very thin hair:</p><h3>1. Kenra Volume Mousse Extra 17</h3><p>This mousse is perfect for fine, thin hair that needs a little extra volume.

This is because the eyes follow the lines and create an illusion of height. Opt for clothes with pinstripes, vertical prints, or vertical pleats.</p><h3>Avoid Oversized Clothes</h3><p>Oversized clothes can make petite people look smaller and shorter. Instead, go for clothes that fit well and are not too loose or too tight. This will create a balanced look and make the body look proportionate.</p><h3>Choose the Right Shoes</h3><p>Wearing the right shoes can make a big difference for petite people. Go for shoes with a pointed toe, high heels, or nude shoes.

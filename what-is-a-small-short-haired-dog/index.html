Consider your living space, your activity level, and your family dynamic. Some breeds may be better suited for apartment living, while others may require a yard to run and play in. It's also important to research each breed's temperament and energy level to make sure they match your own.</p><h3>Step by Step Guide</h3><p>1. Research different breeds of small short haired dogs.<br/> 2. Consider your living space and lifestyle.<br/> 3. Determine which breeds match your needs.<br/> 4.

Then multiply that number by two.</li><li>Face length: Measure from the center of your hairline to the tip of your chin.</li></ul><li>Once you have these measurements, compare them to the different face shapes below.</li></ol><h2 id="face-shape-types">Face Shape Types</h2><p>Now that you have your measurements, let's take a look at the different face shapes:</p><h3>1. Oval</h3><p>If your face length is greater than your cheekbones and your forehead is greater than your jawline, you have an oval face shape. This is considered the most versatile face shape, and most hairstyles will look good on you.</p><h3>2. Round</h3><p>If your face length and cheekbones are roughly equal and your forehead and jawline are also roughly equal, you have a round face shape. Hairstyles that add height and volume on top, or length and layers around the face, can help elongate your face.</p><h3>3. Square</h3><p>If your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are about the same width, you have a square face shape. Softening the angles of your face with layers or curls can help balance out your features.</p><h3>4. Heart</h3><p>If your forehead is wider than your cheekbones and your chin comes to a point, you have a heart-shaped face. Hairstyles that add volume at the chin, like a bob or a pixie cut, can help balance out your features.</p><h3>5. Diamond</h3><p>If you have high cheekbones, a narrow forehead, and a narrow chin, you have a diamond face shape. Short hairstyles that add volume at the top can help balance out your features.</p><h3>6. Oblong</h3><p>If your face is longer than it is wide and your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are roughly the same width, you have an oblong face shape. Hairstyles with volume on the sides, like shoulder-length waves or curls, can help add width to your face.</p><h2 id="tips-for-styling-hair">Tips for Styling Hair by Face Shape</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, here are some tips for styling your hair:</p><h3>Oval:</h3><p>Most hairstyles will look good on you, but avoid styles that cover your forehead.</p><h3>Round:</h3><p>Hairstyles that add height on top, like a high ponytail or a voluminous updo, can elongate your face. Avoid short hairstyles that end at the chin.</p><h3>Square:</h3><p>Softening the angles of your face with layers or curls can help balance out your features. Avoid straight, blunt cuts that end at the jawline.</p><h3>Heart:</h3><p>Hairstyles that add volume at the chin, like a bob or a pixie cut, can help balance out your features. Avoid hairstyles that add volume at the top of your head.</p><h3>Diamond:</h3><p>Short hairstyles that add volume at the top can help balance out your features. Avoid hairstyles that add volume at the sides of your head.</p><h3>Oblong:</h3><p>Hairstyles with volume on the sides, like shoulder-length waves or curls, can help add width to your face. Avoid hairstyles that are too long and straight.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: What if my measurements don't fit into one specific face shape?</h3><p>A: It's possible to have a combination of face shapes. In this case, choose the face shape that you feel best represents your features.</p><h3>Q: Can face shape change over time?</h3><p>A: No, your face shape is determined by bone structure and is unlikely to change over time.</p><h3>Q: What if I don't have a measuring tape or ruler?</h3><p>A: You can use a piece of string and then measure the string with a regular tape measure or ruler.</p><h2 id="hair-care-tips">Hair Care Tips</h2><p>No matter what your face shape is, it's important to take care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly and use a conditioner that's right for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like straighteners and curling irons too often, as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Get regular haircuts to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water to promote hair growth and strength.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to figure out what shape your face is, you can choose hairstyles and makeup that complement your features.

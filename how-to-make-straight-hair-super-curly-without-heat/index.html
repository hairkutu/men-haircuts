There are several types of rollers to choose from, including foam, velcro, and magnetic rollers.</p><p>To use rollers, start by washing and conditioning your hair. Then, apply a styling product to help hold the curls in place. Next, section your hair and roll each section of hair onto the rollers. Once all of your hair is in rollers, allow it to air dry overnight or use a hairdryer on a cool setting to speed up the process. Once your hair is dry, remove the rollers and style as desired.</p><h3>Braiding</h3><p>Braiding is another popular technique for creating curly hair without heat. To create curls with braids, start by washing and conditioning your hair. Then, divide your hair into small sections and braid each section tightly.

Once your hair is dry, remove the braids and style as desired.</p><h3>Twisting</h3><p>Twisting is another technique that can be used to create super curly hair without heat. To twist your hair, start by washing and conditioning your hair. Then, divide your hair into small sections and twist each section tightly. Once all of your hair is twisted, allow it to air dry overnight or use a hairdryer on a cool setting to speed up the process.

Look no further than the iconic 1960's beehive hairstyle! This classic 'do is perfect for special occasions or just adding some vintage flair to your everyday look. In this article, we'll show you step-by-step how to create the perfect beehive hairstyle.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 1960's beehive hairstyle is a voluminous updo that was popularized by celebrities such as Audrey Hepburn and Dusty Springfield. It features a high bouffant at the crown of the head, with hair pulled back and pinned tightly to create a sleek, polished look. This hairstyle is perfect for those with medium to long hair and works best with straight or slightly wavy hair.</p><h2>How To</h2><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and blow-drying your hair, making sure it's completely dry. Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to your roots to give your hair some lift. Brush your hair thoroughly to remove any tangles.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section off the top half of your hair and clip it out of the way. Take a small section of hair from the crown of your head and backcomb it using a teasing brush. Repeat this process with small sections of hair, working your way down the back of your head.</p><h3>Step 3: Create the Bouffant</h3><p>Once you've backcombed the back of your head, smooth the hair down gently with a brush. Take the top section of hair you clipped earlier and backcomb it as well. Smooth the top layer of hair over the backcombed section to create a bouffant. Use bobby pins to secure the bouffant in place.</p><h3>Step 4: Pin the Sides</h3><p>Take the sides of your hair and pull them back, smoothing them as you go. Pin the sides of your hair back, making sure they're tight and secure.</p><h3>Step 5: Create the Beehive</h3><p>Take the remaining hair at the back of your head and backcomb it. Smooth the top layer of hair over the backcombed section to create the beehive. Pin the beehive in place, making sure it's secure.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Spray your hair with a strong hold hairspray to keep it in place. Use a comb or brush to smooth down any stray hairs.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Use a teasing brush or comb to backcomb your hair.</li><li>Be patient and take your time when creating the bouffant and beehive.</li><li>Don't be afraid to use a lot of bobby pins to keep your hair in place.</li><li>Use a strong hold hairspray to keep your hair in place all day.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How long does it take to do a beehive hairstyle?</h3><p>The amount of time it takes to do a beehive hairstyle depends on your hair length and thickness. It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to create the perfect beehive.</p><h3>Can I do a beehive hairstyle on short hair?</h3><p>A beehive hairstyle works best on medium to long hair. If you have short hair, you can still create a similar look by using hair extensions.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your beehive hairstyle looking its best, make sure to use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can damage it and make it harder to style. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</p><p>Now that you know how to do a 1960's beehive hairstyle, you can rock this retro look with confidence. Whether you're attending a formal event or just want to add some vintage flair to your everyday style, the beehive is the perfect choice!</p></article>

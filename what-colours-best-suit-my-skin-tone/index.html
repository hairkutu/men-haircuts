There are a few ways to determine your skin tone:</p><ul><li><strong>Vein Test:</strong> Look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone. If they appear green, you have a warm skin tone. If you can't tell, you have a neutral skin tone.</li><li><strong>Jewellery Test:</strong> Pay attention to whether gold or silver jewellery looks better on you. If gold looks better, you have a warm skin tone. If silver looks better, you have a cool skin tone. If both look good, you have a neutral skin tone.</li><li><strong>Eye and Hair Colour:</strong> Your eye and hair colour can also indicate your skin tone. Cool skin tones usually have blue, grey, or green eyes with blonde, brown or black hair. Warm skin tones usually have brown, amber or hazel eyes with red, blonde or brown hair.</li></ul><p>If you still can't determine your skin tone, it is most likely neutral, and you can wear both warm and cool colours.</p><h2 id="best-colours-for-warm-skin-tone">Best Colours for Warm Skin Tone</h2><p>If you have a warm skin tone, your best colours are warm colours such as earthy shades, oranges, yellows, and reds.

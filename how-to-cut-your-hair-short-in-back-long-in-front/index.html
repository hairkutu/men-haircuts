This haircut is also known as the âmulletâ and has been popular for many years. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to cut your hair short in back long in front. We will also provide you with some tips on how to care for your hair after you have cut it. </p><h2> How to Cut Your Hair Short in Back Long in Front </h2><p> Before we start, it is important to have the right tools. You will need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and a mirror. You may also want to have a hair clip to hold your hair in place. </p><h3> Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair </h3><p> Start by washing your hair and drying it completely. This will make it easier to cut and style. </p><h3> Step 2: Comb Your Hair </h3><p> Comb your hair to remove any tangles or knots. Part your hair in the middle or on the side, depending on how you want your hair to look. </p><h3> Step 3: Cut Your Hair Short in the Back </h3><p> Start at the back of your head and cut your hair short. Use your fingers to measure the length of your hair and cut it accordingly. Cut your hair in a straight line, making sure that it is even. </p><h3> Step 4: Cut Your Hair Long in the Front </h3><p> Once you have cut the back of your hair, move on to the front. Cut your hair in a diagonal line, starting from the back and moving towards the front. This will create a gradual slope. Make sure that your hair is even on both sides. </p><h3> Step 5: Blend the Layers </h3><p> To blend the layers, use your scissors to create a feathered effect. Hold your scissors at an angle and cut into the ends of your hair. This will create a soft and natural look. </p><h3> Tips </h3><p> - Start by cutting your hair longer than you want it to be. You can always cut more if needed. </p><p> - Use a mirror to check the back of your hair. </p><p> - Take your time and be patient. </p><h3> FAQ </h3><p> Q: Can I cut my hair short in the back and long in the front myself? </p><p> A: Yes, you can. However, it is best to have a friend or professional stylist help you. </p><p> Q: How often should I trim my hair after cutting it short in back long in front? </p><p> A: It is recommended to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain the shape and style. </p><h3> Hair Care </h3><p> After you have cut your hair short in back long in front, it is important to take care of your hair. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage. Use a heat protectant spray if you need to use heat styling tools. </p><p> In conclusion, cutting your hair short in back long in front is a great way to update your look. With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a trendy and stylish haircut. Remember to take care of your hair after you have cut it, to keep it looking healthy and shiny. </p></article>

One of the main reasons is the hair cuticle. Asian hair has a round cuticle, which makes it more difficult for the hair to lay flat.

Asian hair is naturally dry and lacks the oils that other hair types have. This can cause the hair to become brittle and prone to breakage, which can lead to split ends and frizz.</p><p>Lastly, genetics can also play a role in why Asian hair sticks out. Some Asians may have thicker hair strands, which can make it harder to manage and style.

It’s characterized by a gradual thinning of the hair, which can eventually lead to baldness. There are several different types of hair loss, including:</p><ul><li>Androgenetic alopecia: This is the most common type of hair loss, and it’s caused by genetics. It affects both men and women, and can start as early as puberty.</li><li>Telogen effluvium: This type of hair loss is caused by stress, illness, or hormonal changes. It’s usually temporary, and the hair will grow back once the underlying cause is treated.</li><li>Alopecia areata: This is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body.</li></ul><h2 id="causes-of-dry-hair">Causes of Dry Hair</h2><p>Dry hair can be caused by a number of factors, including:</p><ul><li>Environmental factors, such as exposure to sun, wind, and dry air</li><li>Chemical treatments, such as coloring, perming, and straightening</li><li>Excessive washing or using harsh shampoos</li><li>Nutritional deficiencies, such as a lack of vitamins and minerals</li><li>Medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism and psoriasis</li></ul><h2 id="relationship-between-dry-hair-and-balding">Relationship Between Dry Hair and Balding</h2><p>While there’s no direct link between dry hair and balding, dry hair can be a sign of an underlying problem that can lead to hair loss.

We have compiled a comprehensive guide to help you find the perfect hairstyle that will flatter your face shape and enhance your natural curls.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Thick wavy hair can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. While it adds volume and texture to your hair, it can also be difficult to manage and style. Coupled with an oval face shape, finding the right haircut can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there are many hairstyles that can complement your hair type and face shape.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>Before you head to the salon, it is essential to have a clear idea of the type of haircut you want. You can browse through magazines, websites, or Pinterest for inspiration. It’s also important to consider your lifestyle and how much time you are willing to spend on styling your hair.</p><h3>1. Layered Bob</h3><p>A layered bob is a great option for thick wavy hair and an oval face shape. It adds movement and texture to your hair while framing your face perfectly. Ask your stylist to add layers to your hair, starting from your chin and gradually getting longer towards the back.</p><h3>2. Long Layers</h3><p>If you prefer to keep your hair long, opt for long layers. This will add volume and texture to your hair without sacrificing the length.

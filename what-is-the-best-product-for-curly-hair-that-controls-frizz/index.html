Serums are lightweight formulas that are designed to smooth and tame frizz without weighing down your curls.

Apply a small amount of serum to your hands and work it through your hair, focusing on the ends and any areas that are prone to frizz.

When the hair cuticle is damaged, it can't retain moisture as effectively, which can lead to frizz. Humidity can also cause the hair cuticle to swell, which can make frizz worse.</p><h3>Can I use a hair serum on dry hair?</h3><p>While hair serums are designed to be used on damp hair, you can also use them on dry hair to tame frizz and add shine. However, be careful not to apply too much serum, as this can make your hair look greasy.</p><h3>How often should I use a hair serum?</h3><p>You can use a hair serum every time you wash your hair, or as needed to tame frizz and add shine. Just be careful not to apply too much, as this can weigh down your curls.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Curly Hair</h2><p>In addition to using a hair serum, there are several other things you can do to care for your curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that are specifically formulated for curly hair.</li><li>Avoid using hot water when washing your hair, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Consider using a leave-in conditioner or deep conditioning treatment to hydrate and nourish your curls.</li><li>Avoid using a towel to dry your hair, as this can cause frizz. Instead, use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to gently squeeze out excess moisture.</li><li>Avoid touching your hair throughout the day, as this can cause frizz.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and using a hair serum, you can keep your curly hair looking its best and control frizz for a more polished and put-together look.</p></article>

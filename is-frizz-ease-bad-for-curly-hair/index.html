Start with a small amount and add more as needed.</li><li>Apply Frizz Ease to wet hair. This will help distribute the product evenly and prevent it from weighing down your curls. Avoid applying Frizz Ease to dry hair, as this can cause frizz and make your hair look greasy.</li><li>Avoid applying Frizz Ease to your scalp.

Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your curls hydrated and defined. Once you've washed your hair, gently towel dry it.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Products</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner and a curl-defining product to your hair. This will help to keep your curls hydrated and defined throughout the day. You can also apply a styling cream or gel to help hold your curls in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Use A Diffuser</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair. This will help to keep your curls intact and prevent frizz. Use a low heat setting and gently scrunch your hair with the diffuser.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, you can style it. You can wear your hair down, pull it back into a ponytail, or braid it.

There are six main face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and triangular. While some haircuts work well on multiple face shapes, it’s essential to choose a style that flatters your natural features. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>Before you can choose the perfect haircut, you need to determine your face shape. Follow these steps to figure out which category you fall into:</p><h3>Oval</h3><p>If your face is longer than it is wide, with a rounded chin and forehead, you likely have an oval face shape. This shape is considered the most versatile, as most haircuts complement it well. </p><h3>Round</h3><p>A round face shape is characterized by a circular shape, with full cheeks and a rounded chin. If your face is nearly as wide as it is long, with no prominent angles, you likely have a round face shape. </p><h3>Square</h3><p>Square face shapes have prominent angles, with a strong jawline and forehead. If your face is roughly the same width from forehead to jaw, with a square jawline, you likely have a square face shape. </p><h3>Heart</h3><p>Heart-shaped faces have a wider forehead and cheekbones, with a narrower jawline and chin. If your face is wider at the temples and narrows toward the chin, you likely have a heart-shaped face. </p><h3>Diamond</h3><p>Diamond face shapes are characterized by high cheekbones, a narrow forehead and chin, and a pointed jawline. If your face is widest at the cheekbones and narrows toward the forehead and jaw, you likely have a diamond face shape. </p><h3>Triangular</h3><p>A triangular face shape has a wide jawline, with a narrower forehead and cheekbones. If your face is widest at the jawline and narrows toward the forehead, you likely have a triangular face shape. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Finding the Perfect Haircut</h2><p>Now that you’ve determined your face shape, it’s time to find the perfect haircut.

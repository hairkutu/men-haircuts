As a result, women may experience hair loss or thinning hair. This type of hair loss is known as androgenetic alopecia, or female pattern hair loss.</p><p>Female pattern hair loss typically begins at the crown of the head and slowly spreads outward. It can also cause a widening part or a noticeable reduction in hair volume.

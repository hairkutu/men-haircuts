This haircut is perfect for guys who want to show off their curly locks while keeping things neat and stylish. In this article, we'll give you a comprehensive guide on how to achieve this look, including how to style it, tips on maintaining it, and more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The men's hair long curly top short sides style, as the name suggests, is characterized by having a longer curly top and shorter sides and back. The length of the top can vary depending on the person's preference, but it typically falls somewhere between the chin and the shoulders. Meanwhile, the sides and back are usually buzzed or faded, creating a nice contrast with the curly top.</p><h2>How to Achieve the Look</h2><p>To achieve the men's hair long curly top short sides style, you'll need to have curly hair that's at least 4-5 inches long on top. If your hair is straight, you can still achieve this look by getting a perm or using a curling iron to create curls. Once you have the desired length and texture, it's time to head to the barber.</p><p>Ask your barber to give you a fade or a buzz cut on the sides and back, leaving the top long and curly. You can also ask for a tapered cut, where the hair gradually gets shorter towards the nape of the neck. Be sure to show your barber a picture of the style you want to ensure that you both have the same idea in mind.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide on How to Style It</h2><p>Styling the men's hair long curly top short sides style is fairly easy. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner designed for curly hair. This will help keep your curls defined and frizz-free.</li><li>Apply a curl-enhancing product, such as a curl cream or mousse, to damp hair. This will help define your curls and add volume to the top.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair while keeping your curls intact. Avoid using a regular hair dryer as it can cause frizz and damage your curls.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a pomade or a hair wax to style the top. You can either leave it messy for a relaxed look or slick it back for a more polished appearance.</li><li>Use a trimmer to maintain the length of the sides and back. You can also ask your barber to do this for you during your regular haircut appointments.</li></ol><h2>Tips on Maintaining the Look</h2><p>Now that you have the men's hair long curly top short sides style, it's important to maintain it to keep it looking great. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Get regular haircuts to keep the sides and back short and neat.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your curls hydrated and healthy.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as flat irons or hair dryers, as it can damage your curls.</li><li>Invest in a good quality curl-enhancing product to enhance your curls and keep them defined.</li><li>Wear a hat or a headband when outdoors to protect your curls from the sun and wind.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I achieve this look with straight hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can achieve this look with straight hair by getting a perm or using a curling iron to create curls.</p><h3>How often should I get a haircut?</h3><p>You should get a haircut every 4-6 weeks to maintain the length of the sides and back.</p><h3>What products should I use to style my hair?</h3><p>You should use a curl-enhancing product, such as a curl cream or mousse, to define your curls and add volume to the top.

It occurs when the immune system attacks hair follicles, causing them to shrink and stop producing hair. Alopecia areata can affect anyone, but it is more common in people with a family history of the condition or those with other autoimmune disorders.</p><h2 id="cause2">Ringworm</h2><p>Ringworm is a fungal infection that can cause round bald spots on the scalp. It is highly contagious and can be spread through direct contact with infected skin or objects. Other symptoms of ringworm include red, scaly patches on the scalp and itching.</p><h2 id="cause3">Traction Alopecia</h2><p>Traction alopecia is hair loss caused by pulling or tension on the hair. It is common in people who wear tight hairstyles, such as braids, weaves, or ponytails. Traction alopecia can cause round bald spots where the hair is pulled tightly.</p><h2 id="cause4">Scarring Alopecia</h2><p>Scarring alopecia is a type of hair loss that occurs when hair follicles are destroyed and replaced with scar tissue. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and burns. Scarring alopecia can cause round bald spots that may be permanent.</p><h2 id="cause5">Chemotherapy</h2><p>Chemotherapy is a common cancer treatment that can cause hair loss. The drugs used in chemotherapy target rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells and hair follicles. Chemotherapy-induced hair loss can cause round bald spots on the scalp.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Treat Round Bald Spots</h2><p>The treatment for round bald spots depends on the underlying cause of the hair loss.

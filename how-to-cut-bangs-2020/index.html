Introduction 2. How to Cut Bangs in 2020 3. Step-by-Step Guide 4. Tips for Cutting Bangs 5. FAQ 6. Hair Care Tips 7. Conclusion Introduction Bangs are a timeless hairstyle that can add a touch of sophistication or playfulness to any look. But cutting bangs can be intimidating, especially if you're doing it for the first time. In this article, we'll show you how to cut bangs in 2020, with a relaxed and easy-to-understand approach. How to Cut Bangs in 2020 Before you start cutting your bangs, you need to decide on the type of bangs you want. There are different styles of bangs, such as blunt, side-swept, choppy, and curtain bangs. You can also choose the length of your bangs, depending on your face shape and personal preference. Once you've decided on the style and length of your bangs, you'll need some tools. You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section your hair. It's also a good idea to have a mirror and some water spray to keep your hair damp. Step-by-Step Guide 1. Start by washing your hair and letting it dry naturally or blow-drying it. Make sure your hair is completely dry before cutting your bangs. 2. Comb your hair straight down and use hair clips to section off the hair you want to cut into bangs. 3. Use your fingers or a comb to measure the length of your bangs. Start by cutting a little bit at a time, and remember that you can always cut more if needed. 4. Cut your bangs in a straight line, starting from the center and working your way outwards. Make sure your scissors are angled downwards, and don't cut too close to your scalp. 5. Check your bangs in the mirror and make any necessary adjustments. If your bangs are too long, you can trim them further. If they're too short, you'll have to wait for them to grow out. 6. Style your bangs by blow-drying them or using a flat iron or curling iron. You can also add some texturizing spray or hair wax to add some volume or texture. Tips for Cutting Bangs - Start with small cuts and work your way up to your desired length. It's easier to cut more hair than to fix a mistake. - Use sharp scissors to prevent split ends and uneven cuts. - Don't cut your bangs when they're wet, as they tend to shrink when they dry. - If you're not confident in cutting your own bangs, ask a friend or a professional stylist for help. FAQ Q: How often should I cut my bangs? A: It depends on how fast your hair grows and how quickly your bangs start to bother you. On average, you can trim your bangs every 4-6 weeks. Q: Can I cut my bangs with regular scissors? A: It's best to use hair-cutting scissors, as they're sharper and designed for cutting hair. Regular scissors can damage your hair and cause split ends. Q: How do I know which bangs will suit my face shape? A: You can consult a hairstylist or look up online guides for choosing bangs according to your face shape. Hair Care Tips To keep your bangs looking fresh and healthy, here are some hair care tips: - Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils. - Avoid using hot styling tools too often, as they can damage your hair and cause split ends. - Trim your bangs regularly to prevent them from getting too long and covering your eyes. - Use a hair serum or oil to protect your hair from heat and add shine. Conclusion Cutting bangs can be a fun and rewarding experience, as long as you take your time and follow the right steps. With this guide, you can confidently cut your own bangs in 2020 and keep them looking great with some hair care tips. </article>

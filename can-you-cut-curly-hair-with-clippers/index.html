Many people with curly hair are hesitant to use clippers because they're not sure if it's the right tool for the job. The good news is that you can use clippers to cut curly hair, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Curly hair can be difficult to manage, and finding the right tool to cut it can be a challenge. Clippers are often associated with straight hair, but they can be used on curly hair as well. However, it's important to use the right technique and to be careful when using clippers on curly hair.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're new to cutting hair with clippers, it's important to start with a clean, dry head of hair. Use a comb to separate the hair into sections, and then use the clippers to cut each section. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard if necessary. Be sure to move the clippers in the direction of the hair growth, and use a light touch to avoid cutting too much hair.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to cutting curly hair with clippers:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair. Make sure it's completely dry before you start cutting.</p><h3>Step 2: Comb your hair</h3><p>Use a comb to separate your hair into sections.

Use a light touch to avoid cutting too much hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Check your work</h3><p>After you've finished cutting, use a mirror to check your work.

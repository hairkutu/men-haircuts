Having a square face shape is one of the most sought-after facial features nowadays. It is because a square-shaped face is often associated with a strong and confident personality. </p><p>In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to make your face square shape, tips, and hair care that will help you achieve the look you desire. Whether you have a round, oval, or heart-shaped face, these tips are applicable to all face shapes.</p><h2>What is a Square Face Shape?</h2><p>A square face shape is characterized by a strong jawline, a broad forehead, and a square-shaped chin. The width of the forehead and the jawline is almost the same, and the face has a symmetrical appearance. Celebrities with a square face shape include Angelina Jolie, Olivia Wilde, and Chris Hemsworth. </p><h2>How to Make Your Face Square Shape?</h2><p>There are several ways to make your face look more square-shaped. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Hairstyle</h3><p>The easiest way to make your face look more square-shaped is by choosing the right hairstyle. A short and layered haircut with bangs that fall on the forehead can help you achieve a more symmetrical look. Avoid hairstyles that are too long and straight because they can make your face look rounder. </p><h3>Contouring</h3><p>Contouring is a makeup technique that involves using darker shades to create shadows and lighter shades to highlight specific areas of the face. To make your face look more square-shaped, use a contouring powder or cream to create shadows along the jawline and the temples. Blend it well to make it look natural. </p><h3>Facial Exercises</h3><p>You can also do facial exercises to make your face look more square-shaped. One exercise is to clench your jawline and hold it for a few seconds, then relax. Do this several times a day to strengthen your jaw muscles. Another exercise is to smile and press your fingertips on the corners of your mouth. Hold it for a few seconds, then release. This exercise helps in defining the cheekbones. </p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Make Your Face Square Shape</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to making your face look more square-shaped:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step is to determine your face shape.

Here are some steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Shampoo and Condition</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo designed for wavy or curly hair. Follow up with a hydrating conditioner to help smooth out any frizz. Rinse your hair with cool water to help seal the cuticles and reduce frizz.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your damp hair to help detangle and add moisture. Use a wide-tooth comb to evenly distribute the product throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your hair, such as a curl cream or mousse. Work the product through your hair, focusing on the mid-lengths to ends. Avoid applying the product to your roots, as this can weigh down your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Diffuse Dry</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. This will help enhance your natural waves and reduce frizz. Use a low-heat setting and scrunch your hair as you dry it.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hair Oil</h3><p>Finish off your hairstyle by applying a small amount of hair oil to your ends. This will help add shine and control any flyaways.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed step by step guide on how to style fine frizzy wavy hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo designed for wavy or curly hair.

This classic hairstyle from the 70s and 80s has been revamped to suit modern tastes and trends. If you're wondering whether feathered hair is in style for 2022, the answer is yes! In this comprehensive guide, we'll take a closer look at this timeless hairstyle and how you can achieve the look.</p><h2>What is Feathered Hair?</h2><p>Feathered hair is a layered haircut that features soft, feather-like layers that frame the face. This hairstyle was first popularized in the 70s by Farrah Fawcett, who sported feathered bangs and soft layers. In the 80s, feathered hair became even more popular with the likes of Madonna and Joan Jett sporting the look.</p><h2>How to Achieve Feathered Hair?</h2><p>To achieve feathered hair, you'll need to visit your hairstylist. The key to this hairstyle is to have layers cut into your hair that are soft and feather-like. Your stylist will likely use a razor to create the layers, which will give your hair a soft, textured look.</p><p>Once you have your haircut, you can style your feathered hair in a variety of ways. You can wear it straight and sleek or add some waves for a more relaxed look. You can also add some volume at the crown of your head for some extra height.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Feathered Hair</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to styling feathered hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Start with clean, dry hair. If you have naturally curly or wavy hair, you may want to straighten it first with a flat iron.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair to prevent damage from heat styling tools.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Round Brush</h3><p>Use a round brush to smooth out your hair as you blow-dry it. Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends, pulling the brush through your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Add Some Waves</h3><p>If you want to add some waves to your hair, use a curling iron to curl sections of your hair away from your face. Hold the curling iron in place for a few seconds before releasing the curl.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish with a light hairspray to hold your style in place. Avoid using too much hairspray, as this can make your hair look stiff and crunchy.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Feathered Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining feathered hair:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to keep your layers looking fresh.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can damage your strands and make your hair look frizzy.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Will feathered hair suit my face shape?</h3><p>A: Feathered hair can suit a variety of face shapes, including round, oval, and heart-shaped faces. Talk to your hairstylist to determine the best cut for your face shape.</p><h3>Q: Can I achieve feathered hair at home?</h3><p>A: It's best to visit a hairstylist to achieve feathered hair. Attempting to cut your own hair can result in an uneven and unflattering look.</p><h3>Q: Will feathered hair work on all hair types?</h3><p>A: Feathered hair can work on a variety of hair types, including straight, wavy, and curly hair. Talk to your hairstylist to determine the best cut for your hair type.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Feathered hair is a timeless hairstyle that is making a comeback in 2022. With soft, feather-like layers that frame the face, this hairstyle can suit a variety of face shapes and hair types. Talk to your hairstylist to achieve the perfect feathered haircut and follow our tips for maintaining your new style.</p></article>

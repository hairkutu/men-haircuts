This era was known for its bold fashion and beauty trends, and the hairstyles were no exception. The short, pixie-like cuts were all the rage, and they're making a comeback today. In this guide, we'll show you how to style short hair 60s for a retro glam look.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 60s were a time of change and rebellion, and the fashion and beauty trends reflected that. Short hair became popular, with women chopping off their locks in favor of bold, edgy cuts. The 60s hairstyle was all about texture, volume, and movement. The hair was often teased, backcombed, and styled into messy, tousled looks.</p><h2>How to Style Short Hair 60s</h2><p>The key to styling short hair 60s is to embrace the texture and movement of your hair. Here are the steps to achieve the perfect retro glam look:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Towel dry your hair and apply a styling mousse or foam to add volume and texture. Blow dry your hair with a round brush to create lift and movement.</p><h3>Step 2: Tease Your Hair</h3><p>To add volume and texture to your hair, tease the crown of your head with a teasing brush. Take small sections of hair and backcomb them at the roots, working your way from the crown to the front of your head.</p><h3>Step 3: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've teased your hair, it's time to style it. Use a curling iron or wand to curl the ends of your hair, creating soft, bouncy waves. You can also use a flat iron to create sleek, polished waves. Finish off your look with a hairspray to hold your hair in place.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect 60s hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Invest in a good quality teasing brush to create volume and texture in your hair.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using hot tools to protect your hair from damage.</li><li>Experiment with different hair accessories, such as headbands and barrettes, to add some extra flair to your look.</li><li>Don't be afraid to play with color. The 60s were all about bold, vibrant hues, so consider adding some highlights or lowlights to your hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about styling short hair 60s:</p><h3>Q: Can I achieve the 60s hairstyle with long hair?</h3><p>A: While the 60s hairstyle was primarily a short hair trend, you can still achieve a similar look with long hair. Consider cutting your hair into a shoulder-length bob and following the same styling steps.</p><h3>Q: What hair products should I use to achieve the 60s hairstyle?</h3><p>A: Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, a styling mousse or foam, and a hairspray to achieve the 60s hairstyle.</p><h3>Q: Can I achieve the 60s hairstyle without using hot tools?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can achieve a similar look by air-drying your hair and using a texture spray to add volume and texture.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>It's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on your hair every day, as this can cause damage and breakage.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep split ends at bay and maintain the shape of your haircut.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals to promote healthy hair growth.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to style short hair 60s and rock the retro glam look with confidence.</p></article>

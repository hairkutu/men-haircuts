Apply the tape in extensions</h3><p>Take one of the tape in extensions and remove the backing. Place the extension underneath a small section of your hair, close to the roots. Press the extension firmly onto your hair to secure it in place. Repeat this process with the remaining extensions, spacing them out evenly.</p><h3>4. Release the top half of your hair</h3><p>Once you've applied all of the extensions, release the top half of your hair and use a comb to blend your natural hair with the extensions.</p><h3>5.

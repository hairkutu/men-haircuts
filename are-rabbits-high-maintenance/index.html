One of the questions you might have in mind is, "are rabbits high maintenance?" The answer is, it depends.

A hutch or cage with enough room for your rabbit to move around, stretch, and stand on their hind legs is important. Additionally, the cage should have a solid floor for comfort and ease of cleaning. Make sure to place the hutch in a shaded or cool area to avoid heat exhaustion and provide ample bedding to keep your rabbit warm.</p><h3>Diet</h3><p>Rabbits need a balanced diet that's rich in hay, vegetables, and fruits. Hay should make up about 80% of their diet, with the rest consisting of vegetables and a small amount of fruit. Make sure to avoid giving your rabbit sugary and starchy foods to prevent digestive issues.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Exercise is crucial to keep your rabbit healthy and happy.

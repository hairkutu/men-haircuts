This will help prevent any breakage or damage to your hair during the picking process.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into manageable sections using hair clips or elastics. This will make it easier to pick out your hair and ensure you don't miss any sections.</p><h3>Step 4: Pick Your Hair Out</h3><p>Starting at the roots, use a comb or pick to gently lift and shape your hair. Work your way through each section, picking out your hair until you achieve your desired look.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've picked out your hair, you can style it as desired.

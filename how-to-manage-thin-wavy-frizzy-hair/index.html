Thin hair means that you have fewer hair strands than normal, while wavy hair means that your hair has a natural wave or curl. Frizzy hair is caused by a lack of moisture and can be exacerbated by humidity or dryness.</p><p>To manage this hair type, you need to focus on two things: moisture and styling. You should use products that are designed to add moisture to your hair, such as hydrating shampoos and conditioners. You should also avoid using heat styling tools, as they can damage your hair and make it more prone to frizz.</p><h3 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to manage thin wavy frizzy hair:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a hydrating shampoo and conditioner.

Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel, as this can cause damage and breakage.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to your hair. This will help to lock in moisture and prevent frizz.</li><li>Detangle your hair using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots.</li><li>If you want to style your hair, use a mousse or hair gel that is designed for wavy hair.

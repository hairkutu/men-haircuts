Fleas can cause a lot of discomfort for your dog, including itching, scratching, and hair loss. If your dog has suffered from a flea infestation, you may be wondering how long it will take for their hair to grow back. In this article, we will explore this question and provide you with some tips for caring for your dog's hair during the regrowth process.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Fleas are a common problem for dogs, especially during the warmer months. These pesky parasites can cause a lot of discomfort for your furry friend and can even lead to more serious health problems if left untreated. One of the most common symptoms of a flea infestation is hair loss. When dogs scratch and bite at their skin to relieve the itching caused by fleas, they can end up damaging their hair follicles, leading to hair loss.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If your dog has suffered from a flea infestation and hair loss, there are some things you can do to help promote hair regrowth. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Treat the Fleas</h3><p>The first step in promoting hair regrowth is to get rid of the fleas.

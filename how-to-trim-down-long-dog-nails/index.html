How often should I trim my dog's nails?</h3><p>A. It depends on the breed and the activity level of your dog. Generally, you should trim your dog's nails once every four to six weeks. However, if your dog is very active, you may need to trim their nails more frequently.</p><h3>Q. Can I use human nail clippers to trim my dog's nails?</h3><p>A.

If the bleeding does not stop after a few minutes, contact your veterinarian.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After trimming your dog's nails, you should reward them with a good bath and brushing.

There are different products that you can use, such as pomades, gels, and waxes. These products differ in their hold and shine levels. Pomades provide a medium hold and high shine, while gels provide a strong hold and wet look. Waxes provide a strong hold and low shine. </p><p>Before you start slicking back your hair, make sure that your hair is clean and dry. Wet hair will dilute the product and make it less effective. You can use a blow dryer to dry your hair quickly. </p><h2 id="stepbystep"> Step-by-Step Instructions </h2><p>Now that you know the basics, let's go over the step-by-step instructions on how to train hair slick back. </p><h3> Step 1: Apply Product </h3><p>Take a small amount of product and rub it between your palms to warm it up.

Make sure that your hair is slicked back evenly and there are no bumps or flyaways. </p><h3> Step 3: Train Hair </h3><p>Use your hands to push your hair back and train it to stay slicked back. You can also use a hairbrush to brush your hair back and train it. Repeat this step until your hair stays slicked back on its own. </p><h3> Step 4: Finish </h3><p>Use a small amount of product to touch up any areas that need it.

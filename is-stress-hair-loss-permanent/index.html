Hair growth occurs in three stages:</p><ul><li>Anagen Phase: This is the active phase of hair growth, which lasts for 2-7 years.</li><li>Catagen Phase: This is a transitional phase that lasts for around 10 days.</li><li>Telogen Phase: This is the resting phase, which lasts for around 3 months. During this phase, the hair falls out and new hair begins to grow.</li></ul><p>On average, we lose around 50-100 hairs per day. However, this hair loss is usually balanced out by new hair growth. When hair loss exceeds hair growth, it can lead to thinning hair and baldness.</p><h2 id="section2">How Stress Affects Hair Growth</h2><p>Stress can impact our bodies in many ways, including our hair growth cycle. When we experience stress, our bodies release a hormone called cortisol. High levels of cortisol can disrupt the hair growth cycle, causing more hairs to enter the telogen phase and fall out.</p><p>In addition to disrupting the hair growth cycle, stress can also lead to other hair-related problems, such as:</p><ul><li>Dandruff</li><li>Oily scalp</li><li>Breakage</li><li>Thinning</li></ul><h2 id="section3">Is Stress Hair Loss Permanent?</h2><p>The good news is that stress-related hair loss is usually not permanent. Once the stressor is removed, the hair growth cycle should return to normal. However, itâs important to note that it can take several months for hair to grow back.</p><p>Itâs also important to note that some types of hair loss, such as androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness), are permanent and not related to stress. If you are experiencing hair loss and are unsure of the cause, itâs best to consult with a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="section4">How to Prevent Stress-Related Hair Loss</h2><p>The best way to prevent stress-related hair loss is to manage your stress levels. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga.</li><li>Exercise regularly.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet.</li><li>Get enough sleep.</li><li>Take breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge.</li></ul><h2 id="section5">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Can stress cause permanent hair loss?</h3><p>Stress-related hair loss is usually not permanent.

Some types of hair loss, such as androgenetic alopecia, are permanent and cannot be reversed.

If you are experiencing hair loss, it is important to see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.</p><h3>Stress</h3><p>Stress can also cause hair loss in black women. When we are stressed, our bodies produce cortisol, which can lead to hair loss. Finding ways to manage stress, such as through exercise or meditation, can help prevent hair loss.</p><h3>Chemical Treatments</h3><p>Chemical treatments, such as relaxers, can also cause hair loss in black women.

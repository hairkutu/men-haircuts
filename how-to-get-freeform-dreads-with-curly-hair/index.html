Instead, use a natural conditioner or apple cider vinegar to cleanse the scalp and hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Let Your Hair Grow</h3><p>Next, let your hair grow out. The longer your hair, the easier it will be to form dreadlocks. As your hair grows, avoid brushing or combing it. This will allow the hair to naturally tangle and form dreads.</p><h3>Step 3: Separate the Dreads</h3><p>As your hair begins to tangle and form dreads, it's important to separate them to prevent them from merging together. Use your fingers to gently pull apart any dreads that are starting to merge together.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you understand the basic steps to getting freeform dreads, let's break it down into a step-by-step guide.</p><h3>Step 1: Stop Using Shampoo</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, stop using shampoo and instead use a natural conditioner or apple cider vinegar to cleanse your scalp and hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Let Your Hair Grow</h3><p>Allow your hair to grow out without brushing or combing it.

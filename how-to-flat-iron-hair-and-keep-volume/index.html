Use a shampoo and conditioner that are designed for your hair type, and consider using a volumizing conditioner to help give your hair some extra lift.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Before you start flat ironing your hair, it's important to protect your hair from heat damage. Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair, focusing on the ends where your hair is most vulnerable to damage.</p><h3>Step 3: Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow dry your hair using a round brush to create volume. You can also flip your head upside down and blow dry your hair from the roots to create even more volume. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start flat ironing.</p><h3>Step 4: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into small sections using clips or hair ties. This will make it easier to flat iron your hair evenly and ensure that you don't miss any sections.</p><h3>Step 5: Flat Iron Your Hair</h3><p>Starting with one section of hair, clamp the flat iron as close to the roots as possible and glide it down the length of your hair. Make sure to keep the flat iron moving smoothly and quickly, without stopping or pausing in any one spot. Repeat this process with each section of hair until your entire head is flat ironed.</p><h3>Step 6: Add Volume</h3><p>Once your hair is flat ironed, you can use a few tricks to add volume. Try backcombing the hair at the crown of your head, or using a volumizing powder or spray to give your roots some lift. You can also flip your hair upside down and gently massage your roots to create more volume.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Flat Ironing Hair with Volume</h2><p>Here are a few additional tips to help you flat iron your hair while maintaining volume:</p><ul><li>Choose a flat iron with ceramic plates, which distribute heat evenly and are less likely to cause damage to your hair.</li><li>Don't flat iron your hair too often, as this can cause damage and breakage.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to gently detangle your hair before flat ironing, which will help prevent damage and breakage.</li><li>Apply a small amount of hair oil or serum to the ends of your hair after flat ironing to add shine and prevent frizz.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Flat Ironing Hair with Volume</h2><h3>Can you flat iron hair without damaging it?</h3><p>Flat ironing your hair can cause damage if you don't use the right products and techniques.

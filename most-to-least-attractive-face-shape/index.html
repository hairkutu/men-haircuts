In this article, we'll break down the most to least attractive face shapes and give you tips on how to flatter your unique features. Let's get started!</p><h2>What are the Most Attractive Face Shapes?</h2><p>According to a study published in the journal <i>Evolution and Human Behavior,</i> the most attractive face shape is an oval-shaped face. Other attractive face shapes include:</p><ul><li>Heart-shaped face</li><li>Square-shaped face</li><li>Diamond-shaped face</li><li>Round-shaped face</li><li>Triangle-shaped face</li></ul><p>So, what makes these face shapes so appealing? Researchers believe that these shapes are considered attractive because they are symmetrical and well-proportioned. Additionally, these face shapes tend to have features that are in harmony with one another, such as a balanced jawline and cheekbones.</p><h3>How to Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>Before we dive into which hairstyles and makeup tips work best for each face shape, let's first determine your face shape. Here's how:</p><ol><li>Pull your hair back away from your face.</li><li>Stand in front of a mirror.</li><li>Use a washable marker to trace the outline of your face on the mirror.</li><li>Step back and look at the shape you traced. Compare it to the shapes listed above.</li></ol><p>Once you've determined your face shape, you can start playing around with hairstyles and makeup that enhance your features.</p><h3>Hairstyles for Each Face Shape</h3><p>Now that you know your face shape, let's discuss hairstyles that flatter your features.</p><h4>Oval-Shaped Face</h4><p>Since an oval-shaped face is already considered the most attractive, you have a lot of versatility when it comes to hairstyles. You can pull off almost any cut or style, including:</p><ul><li>Long layers</li><li>Short pixie cuts</li><li>Bob haircuts</li><li>Side-swept bangs</li></ul><p>Just be sure to avoid styles that add too much volume to the sides of your face, as this can throw off the balance of your features.</p><h4>Heart-Shaped Face</h4><p>If you have a heart-shaped face, your forehead is wider than your jawline, and you have a pointy chin. Hairstyles that work well for this face shape include:</p><ul><li>Long layers that graze your cheekbones</li><li>Side-swept bangs</li><li>Chin-length bobs</li></ul><p>Avoid styles that add too much volume to the top of your head, as this can make your forehead appear even wider.</p><h4>Square-Shaped Face</h4><p>If you have a square-shaped face, your jawline is the most prominent feature. Hairstyles that soften your jawline and add volume to the top of your head work well, such as:</p><ul><li>Long, layered waves</li><li>Side-swept bangs</li><li>Long bobs</li></ul><p>Avoid blunt cuts that end at your jawline, as this can make your face appear boxy.</p><h4>Diamond-Shaped Face</h4><p>If you have a diamond-shaped face, your cheekbones are the most prominent feature. Hairstyles that draw attention to your eyes and cheekbones work well, such as:</p><ul><li>Side-swept bangs</li><li>Updos that pull your hair away from your face</li><li>Long, layered waves</li></ul><p>Avoid styles that add too much volume to the sides of your face, as this can throw off the balance of your features.</p><h4>Round-Shaped Face</h4><p>If you have a round-shaped face, your cheeks are the most prominent feature. Hairstyles that elongate your face and add volume to the top of your head work well, such as:</p><ul><li>Long, layered waves</li><li>Side-swept bangs</li><li>High ponytails</li><li>Long bobs</li></ul><p>Avoid short, blunt cuts that end at your chin, as this can make your face appear even rounder.</p><h4>Triangle-Shaped Face</h4><p>If you have a triangle-shaped face, your jawline is the most prominent feature. Hairstyles that add volume to the top of your head and soften your jawline work well, such as:</p><ul><li>Long bobs</li><li>Side-swept bangs</li><li>Updos that pull your hair away from your face</li></ul><p>Avoid styles that add too much volume to the sides of your face, as this can make your jawline appear even wider.</p><h3>Makeup Tips for Each Face Shape</h3><p>Now that you've got your hairstyle sorted, let's talk about makeup tips that flatter your unique features.</p><h4>Oval-Shaped Face</h4><p>Since an oval-shaped face is already considered the most attractive, you don't need to do much to enhance your features. Focus on enhancing your natural beauty with minimal makeup, such as:</p><ul><li>A light foundation</li><li>Mascara</li><li>A neutral lip color</li></ul><h4>Heart-Shaped Face</h4><p>If you have a heart-shaped face, focus on creating balance between your forehead and chin. Use contouring techniques to soften your chin and add definition to your cheekbones. You can also experiment with bold lip colors, such as red or berry shades.</p><h4>Square-Shaped Face</h4><p>To soften the angles of your face, use contouring techniques to shade your jawline and highlight your cheekbones. Focus on creating a soft, natural look with your makeup, using neutral shades on your eyes and a nude lip color.</p><h4>Diamond-Shaped Face</h4><p>To enhance your cheekbones, use a blush or bronzer to add color to the apples of your cheeks. You can also experiment with bold eye makeup, such as a smoky eye or winged eyeliner.</p><h4>Round-Shaped Face</h4><p>To elongate your face, use contouring techniques to shade the sides of your face and highlight the center. Use a matte bronzer to add definition to your cheekbones and a bright, bold lip color to draw attention to your mouth.</p><h4>Triangle-Shaped Face</h4><p>Since your jawline is the most prominent feature, focus on softening it with contouring techniques. Use a highlighter on the center of your forehead and nose to draw attention to your eyes. You can also experiment with bold lip colors to draw attention away from your jawline.</p><h3>Hair Care Tips for Each Face Shape</h3><p>No matter what your face shape is, healthy hair is always in style. Here are some hair care tips that work well for each face shape:</p><h4>Oval-Shaped Face</h4><p>Since you have a lot of versatility when it comes to hairstyles, focus on keeping your hair healthy and shiny.

If you want a dog that doesn't require a lot of exercise, look for breeds that are content with short walks, like a Shih Tzu or a Pekingese.</p><p>It's also important to consider the dog's personality and temperament. Some breeds are more independent and don't require as much attention, while others are more affectionate and crave human interaction.

If you have damage or split ends, trim them off before you begin.</li><li>Invest in a high-quality shampoo and conditioner designed for curly hair. Look for products that are sulfate-free and contain moisturizing ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil.</li><li>Massage your scalp regularly to stimulate blood flow and promote growth. Use your fingertips to gently rub your scalp in circular motions for a few minutes each day.</li><li>Avoid heat styling and chemical treatments as much as possible. If you must use heat, be sure to use a heat protectant spray first.</li><li>Consider taking a biotin supplement to promote hair growth. Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for healthy hair, skin, and nails.</li><li>Avoid pulling your hair back too tightly, as this can cause breakage and damage. If you need to pull your hair back, use a soft scrunchie or hair tie instead of a tight elastic band.</li><li>Protect your hair while you sleep by using a silk or satin pillowcase. These materials are gentler on hair than cotton and can help prevent breakage and frizz.</li><li>Experiment with different styling techniques to find what works best for your hair. Some people find that diffusing their curls with a hair dryer works well, while others prefer to air dry.</li><li>Consider getting regular deep conditioning treatments to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.

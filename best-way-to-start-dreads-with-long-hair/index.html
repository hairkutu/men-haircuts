Dreads, also known as dreadlocks, are a popular hairstyle that has been around for centuries. It is a style that is often associated with the Rastafarian culture and has gained popularity in recent years. If you have long hair and are interested in starting dreads, this article is for you. We will be covering everything from how to start your dreads to hair care tips to keep them healthy and looking great.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Dreads are a hairstyle where the hair is twisted and matted together to form long, rope-like strands. This style can be achieved with any hair type, but it is important to note that it may take longer for those with long hair to form tight, well-defined dreads. Starting dreads with long hair requires patience, dedication, and a bit of know-how. </p><h2>How to Start Dreads with Long Hair</h2><p>The first step in starting dreads with long hair is to decide on the method you will use. There are several methods to choose from, including the backcombing method, the twist and rip method, and the neglect method. Each method has its own pros and cons, and it is important to research each method thoroughly before making a decision.</p><h3>Backcombing Method</h3><p>The backcombing method involves teasing the hair backwards using a comb to create knots. This method is great for those with straight or wavy hair and can be used to create well-defined dreads quickly. </p><h3>Twist and Rip Method</h3><p>The twist and rip method involves twisting small sections of hair and ripping them apart to create knots. This method is great for those with curly or kinky hair and can create loose, natural-looking dreads. </p><h3>Neglect Method</h3><p>The neglect method involves simply letting your hair grow and form knots on its own. This method is great for those who want a low-maintenance approach to dreadlocks but may take longer to form well-defined dreads.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Starting Dreads with Long Hair</h2><p>Regardless of the method you choose, there are some general steps you should follow when starting dreads with long hair:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair thoroughly and let it air dry.</li><li>Divide your hair into small sections using hair ties or clips.</li><li>Start at the roots and work your way to the ends, using your chosen method to create knots in each section.</li><li>Use a crochet hook or your fingers to tighten the knots and shape your dreads.</li><li>Be patient and avoid washing your hair for at least a week to allow the dreads to form and set.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Starting Dreads with Long Hair</h2><p>Starting dreads with long hair can be a long and challenging process. Here are some tips to help you along the way:</p><ul><li>Be patient â it can take several months for your dreads to fully form.</li><li>Avoid using conditioner or other products that may cause buildup in your hair.</li><li>Use a satin or silk pillowcase to prevent your dreads from getting tangled while you sleep.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, as they can damage your hair and make it harder to form dreads.</li><li>Consider using a locking gel or spray to help your dreads form and stay in place.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take to form dreads with long hair?</h3><p>The time it takes to form dreads with long hair depends on several factors, including your hair type, the method you use, and how well you care for your dreads. It can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to form well-defined dreads.</p><h3>Can I start dreads with relaxed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can start dreads with relaxed hair, but it may take longer for your dreads to form and set. It is important to avoid using any chemicals or heat styling tools on your hair while you are starting your dreads to prevent damage.</p><h2>Hair Care for Dreads with Long Hair</h2><p>Once your dreads are formed, it is important to take care of them properly to keep them looking great. Here are some hair care tips for dreads with long hair:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a residue-free shampoo.</li><li>Avoid using products that contain alcohol, as they can dry out your dreads.</li><li>Use a hair oil or moisturizer to keep your dreads hydrated and prevent breakage.</li><li>Be gentle when detangling your dreads to prevent them from unraveling or breaking.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, starting dreads with long hair can be a challenging but rewarding process. By following the tips and steps outlined in this article, you can achieve the perfect set of dreads in no time. Remember to be patient, take care of your dreads properly, and enjoy this unique and stylish hairstyle.</p></article>

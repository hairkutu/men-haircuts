Although its main symptoms are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, there have been reports of hair loss after COVID-19. </p><h2>What is COVID-19?</h2><p>COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Hair loss is a common symptom of many illnesses, including viral infections. However, the severity and duration of hair loss may vary from person to person. </p><h3>Why Does Hair Loss Happen?</h3><p>Hair loss can occur for several reasons, such as stress, hormonal changes, genetics, and vitamin deficiencies. In the case of COVID-19, hair loss can happen due to the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Physical stress caused by the illness</li><li>Emotional stress caused by the pandemic</li><li>Malnutrition due to loss of appetite or difficulty eating</li><li>Medications used to treat COVID-19</li></ul><h3>How to Prevent Hair Loss after COVID-19?</h3><p>Preventing hair loss after COVID-19 involves taking care of your overall health and well-being. Here are some tips to prevent hair loss:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy and balanced diet</li><li>Get enough sleep and rest</li><li>Exercise regularly</li><li>Manage stress through meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques</li><li>Take prescribed medications as directed by your doctor</li></ul><h3>How to Treat Hair Loss after COVID-19?</h3><p>If you are experiencing hair loss after COVID-19, there are several treatments available to help promote hair growth.

However, in rare cases, it may lead to permanent hair loss, especially if it is due to scarring alopecia.</p><h3>Can wearing a mask cause hair loss?</h3><p>Wearing a mask does not cause hair loss, but it may cause some hair breakage or damage around the ears due to friction or tension.</p><h3>Can stress cause hair loss?</h3><p>Yes, stress is one of the most common causes of hair loss. It can cause a condition called telogen effluvium, in which hair follicles prematurely enter the resting phase, leading to hair shedding.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>COVID-19 can cause hair loss as a result of physical and emotional stress, malnutrition, and medications.

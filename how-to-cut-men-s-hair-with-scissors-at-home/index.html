Or maybe you can't get to the barber during the pandemic. Whatever the reason, cutting men's hair at home has become a popular option in recent times. In this guide, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of cutting men's hair with scissors at home, so you can save some cash and get a fresh new look.</p><h2>How to Cut Men's Hair with Scissors at Home</h2><p>Before we dive into the actual haircut, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p><h3>1. Gather Your Supplies</h3><p>You'll need a few key supplies to get started:</p><ul><li>Haircutting scissors</li><li>Clipper or comb</li><li>Comb</li><li>Hair ties or clips</li><li>Spray bottle filled with water</li><li>Mirror</li></ul><p>Make sure your scissors are sharp and clean before you start. You can use alcohol or a disinfectant to clean them before use.</p><h3>2. Choose Your Hairstyle</h3><p>Have a clear idea of the hairstyle you want before you start cutting. Look for inspiration online or bring a photo to reference. It's also important to consider your hair type and face shape when choosing a hairstyle.</p><h3>3. Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before you start cutting. It's easier to cut dry hair and you'll have a better idea of how the hair will fall.</p><h3>4. Take it Slow</h3><p>Don't rush through the haircut. Take your time and make small cuts as you go. It's better to cut too little than too much.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Men's Hair with Scissors at Home</h2><h3>Step 1: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using your clipper or comb, section your hair into manageable parts. Start with the sides and back, then move to the top of your head.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use your scissors to cut the hair on the sides and back of your head. Start at the bottom and work your way up, making small cuts as you go. Use a comb to guide the hair and create a natural-looking fade.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Top</h3><p>Take small sections of hair and cut them to the desired length. Use your fingers or a comb to guide the hair and make sure it's even. Don't cut too much at once - it's better to make multiple small cuts than one big one.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Use your scissors to blend the hair at the top of your head with the sides and back. Make small cuts and use a comb to create a seamless transition.</p><h3>Step 5: Trim the Bangs</h3><p>If you have bangs, use your scissors to trim them to the desired length. Again, start with small cuts and work your way up.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Men's Hair with Scissors at Home</h2><p>Here are a few tips to help you get the best results:</p><ul><li>Invest in a good pair of haircutting scissors - they'll make a big difference.</li><li>Use a comb to guide the hair and create even cuts.</li><li>Don't cut too much at once - it's easier to make small cuts than fix a big mistake.</li><li>Take breaks if you need to - cutting hair can be tiring.</li></ul><h2>FAQ about Cutting Men's Hair with Scissors at Home</h2><h3>Can I cut my own hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own hair with scissors. It takes practice, but it's doable.</p><h3>How do I cut my hair evenly?</h3><p>Use a comb to guide the hair and make sure you're cutting at the same angle. Take small cuts and check for symmetry as you go.</p><h3>Can I use regular scissors to cut hair?</h3><p>No, regular scissors are not sharp enough for cutting hair. You'll need a pair of haircutting scissors.</p><h2>Hair Care After Cutting Men's Hair with Scissors at Home</h2><p>Congratulations, you've successfully cut your own hair! Here are a few tips to keep your hair healthy and looking good:</p><ul><li>Wash and condition your hair regularly.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as it can cause damage.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair looking neat.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to cut men's hair with scissors at home, you can save money and get a fresh new look. Remember to take your time, make small cuts, and have fun with it!</p></article>

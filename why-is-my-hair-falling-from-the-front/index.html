Read our FAQ section for more information." /><p>If you're experiencing hair loss from the front of your head, you're not alone. This type of hair loss is known as frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) and is becoming increasingly common. In this article, we'll explain why your hair might be falling out from the front and what you can do to prevent it from happening.</p><h2>What is Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia?</h2><p>Frontal fibrosing alopecia is a condition that causes hair loss from the front of the scalp. It's most common in women over the age of 50, but it can affect men and women of all ages. The condition is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair in the front of the scalp.</p><h2>What Causes Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia?</h2><p>The exact cause of frontal fibrosing alopecia is unknown, but it's thought to be an autoimmune disorder. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, causing them to shrink and eventually stop producing hair. Hormonal changes, genetics, and environmental factors may also play a role in the development of the condition.</p><h2>How to Prevent Hair Loss From the Front</h2><p>There are several things you can do to prevent hair loss from the front of your head. Here are a few tips:</p><h3>1. Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Tight hairstyles, such as braids and ponytails, can put stress on the hair follicles and cause them to become damaged. Try to avoid these hairstyles or wear them loosely.</p><h3>2. Protect Your Hair From the Sun</h3><p>Exposure to the sun's UV rays can damage hair follicles and cause hair loss. Wear a hat or use a hair product with SPF to protect your hair from the sun.</p><h3>3. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>A healthy diet can help promote hair growth and prevent hair loss. Make sure you're getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.</p><h3>4. Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress can cause hair loss, so it's important to find ways to manage stress in your life. Try yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.</p><h3>5. Use Gentle Hair Products</h3><p>Avoid using harsh chemicals and heat styling tools on your hair. Use gentle hair products and let your hair air dry whenever possible.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What are the first signs of hair loss from the front?</h3><p>The first signs of hair loss from the front may include a receding hairline and thinning hair in the front of the scalp.</p><h3>Can hair loss from the front be reversed?</h3><p>In some cases, hair loss from the front may be reversible.

Your doctor may recommend topical or oral medications, hair transplant surgery, or other treatments.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for preventing hair loss and promoting healthy hair growth. Here are a few tips:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly to remove dirt and oil that can clog hair follicles and cause hair loss.</p><h3>2. Use a Conditioner</h3><p>Conditioner can help keep your hair moisturized and prevent damage.</p><h3>3. Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help prevent split ends and breakage.</p><h3>4.

Size</h3><p>The size of your dog will depend on the size of your farm and the types of animals you have. If you have a large farm with lots of animals, a larger dog like a Border Collie or Australian Cattle Dog may be a good choice. If you have a smaller farm with fewer animals, a smaller breed like a Beagle or Jack Russell Terrier may be a better fit.</p><h3>2.

Make sure you have the time and resources to provide your dog with the exercise they need to stay happy and healthy.</p><h3>3.

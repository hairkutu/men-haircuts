Frizziness can make your hair look unruly and unmanageable, making it difficult to style and maintain. If you're wondering why the top part of your hair is frizzy, keep reading for some answers and tips on how to combat frizziness.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Frizzy hair occurs when the outer layer of your hair, also known as the cuticle, is raised, allowing moisture to penetrate the hair shaft. This causes the hair to swell and become frizzy. There are many factors that can contribute to frizziness, including genetics, humidity, heat styling, and chemical treatments.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're dealing with frizziness on the top part of your hair, there are a few things you can do to combat it. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Use a Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner</h3><p>One of the main causes of frizzy hair is lack of moisture. Using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner can help to hydrate your hair and prevent frizziness. Look for products that contain ingredients such as coconut oil, argan oil, and shea butter.</p><h3>2. Don't Overwash Your Hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, which can lead to frizziness. Try to wash your hair no more than every other day, and use a dry shampoo in between washes if needed.</p><h3>3. Use a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>A leave-in conditioner can help to tame frizz and keep your hair smooth and hydrated. Apply a small amount to the top part of your hair after washing and conditioning.</p><h3>4. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools such as flat irons and curling irons can damage your hair and lead to frizziness. Try to avoid using them as much as possible, or use a heat protectant spray before styling.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to combatting frizziness on the top part of your hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</h3><p>Look for products that contain hydrating ingredients such as coconut oil, argan oil, and shea butter.</p><h3>Step 2: Don't overwash your hair.</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and lead to frizziness.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply a leave-in conditioner.</h3><p>A leave-in conditioner can help to tame frizz and keep your hair smooth and hydrated.</p><h3>Step 4: Avoid heat styling.</h3><p>Heat styling tools can damage your hair and lead to frizziness.

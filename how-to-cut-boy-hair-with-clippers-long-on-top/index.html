If your child wants a trendy style with long hair on top, using clippers can make the process much easier. In this article, we'll walk you through how to cut boy hair with clippers long on top, step by step. </p><h2>Description</h2><p>The long-on-top haircut is a popular style for boys, and it's easy to see why. This cut is versatile and can be styled in many different ways. The key to getting this look right is to use clippers and scissors correctly to achieve the right length and texture.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Before you begin, make sure you have a good quality pair of clippers, scissors, and a comb. You'll also need a spray bottle filled with water to dampen the hair as you work.</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>The first step is to choose the right length for the hair on top. You can use the #4 guard on the clippers to start. This will leave the hair about ½ inch long. If you want it shorter, use a lower number guard.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use the clippers to cut the sides and back of the head, starting from the bottom and working your way up. Use the same guard length as the top or a shorter one if preferred. Use a smaller guard to taper the sides and back for a more natural look. Use scissors for any trimming you need around the ears and neck.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Top</h3><p>Now it's time to cut the hair on top. Start at the front and work your way back. Use the clippers with the same guard as the sides to cut the hair in a straight line from front to back. Be sure to blend the sides and back with the top for a seamless look. </p><h3>Step 4: Texturize</h3><p>Use scissors to texturize the hair on top, removing any bulk and creating a more natural look. Hold the hair between your fingers and snip small sections at a time. Be sure to blend with the sides and back as you work.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>- Start with a longer guard and work your way down if needed.</p><p>- Use scissors to blend and texturize the hair for a more natural look. </p><p>- Don't forget to trim around the ears and neck with scissors.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I cut my child's hair with regular scissors?</h3><p>While you can technically cut hair with regular scissors, it's not recommended. Hair-cutting scissors are sharper and more precise, so you'll get a better result.</p><h3>How often should I cut my child's hair?</h3><p>That depends on how quickly their hair grows and how long they want to keep their hair. On average, boys' hair grows about ½ inch per month, so you may need to trim it every 4-6 weeks to maintain the style.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your child's hair looking its best, be sure to wash it regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Use a wide-tooth comb or brush to detangle wet hair, and let it air dry if possible. Avoid using heat styling tools on a regular basis, as this can damage the hair.</p><p>With these tips and techniques, you can confidently cut your child's hair with clippers and achieve a stylish long-on-top look. Happy cutting!</p></article>

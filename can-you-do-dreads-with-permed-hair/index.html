The good news is – it is! While it might require some extra effort, permed hair can be successfully transformed into beautiful dreadlocks. In this post, we'll discuss everything you need to know about this process – from how to do it to tips and FAQs to ensure you get the best results.</p><h2>How to Do Dreads with Permed Hair?</h2><p>The process of doing dreads with permed hair is similar to creating dreadlocks with natural hair, with a few additional steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Get Your Hair Ready</h3><p>Before starting the process, make sure your hair is in good condition. This means it should be clean, moisturized, and free from any products or buildup. You can use a clarifying shampoo to remove any residue or buildup that might be present in your hair. </p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small, equal-sized parts. You can use a rat-tail comb to make clean and even sections. </p><h3>Step 3: Twist and Backcomb</h3><p>Take each section of hair and twist it tightly. Then, use a comb to backcomb the hair from the roots to the tips. This will create knots in the hair, which will eventually turn into dreadlocks. Repeat this process for each section of hair. </p><h3>Step 4: Secure the Dreads</h3><p>Once you've twisted and backcombed all sections of hair, you can secure the dreads in place. You can use rubber bands or hair clips to hold the dreads together. </p><h3>Step 5: Maintain Your Dreads</h3><p>Maintaining your dreads is essential to ensure they look good and last long. You can use a residue-free shampoo to clean your hair regularly, and use a dreadlock conditioner to keep your hair moisturized. You can also use a crochet hook to tighten any loose knots or stray hairs. </p><h2>Tips for Doing Dreads with Permed Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to ensure you get the best results when doing dreads with permed hair:</p><ul><li>Make sure your hair is healthy and strong before starting the process.</li><li>Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or residue from your hair.</li><li>Section your hair evenly and accurately to ensure the dreads are uniform in size.</li><li>Twist and backcomb each section of hair tightly to create knots that will turn into dreadlocks.</li><li>Use rubber bands or hair clips to hold the dreads in place while they mature.</li><li>Use a residue-free shampoo and dreadlock conditioner to keep your hair clean and moisturized.</li><li>Use a crochet hook to tighten any loose knots or stray hairs.</li></ul><h2>FAQs About Doing Dreads with Permed Hair</h2><h3>Can I do dreads with chemically treated hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can do dreads with permed or chemically treated hair. However, it's important to make sure your hair is in good condition before starting the process.</p><h3>How long will it take for my dreads to mature?</h3><p>It can take anywhere from six months to a year for your dreads to mature, depending on your hair type and how well you maintain them.</p><h3>Can I wash my hair with regular shampoo?</h3><p>No, it's not recommended to use regular shampoo on dreadlocks, as it can leave residue and buildup. Use a residue-free shampoo specifically designed for dreadlocks.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for Dreadlocks</h2><p>Here are some general hair care tips to keep your dreadlocks healthy and beautiful:</p><ul><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage.</li><li>Avoid using heavy products on your hair, as they can weigh down your dreads.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Eat a healthy and balanced diet to promote hair growth and strength.</li></ul><p>Doing dreads with permed hair is a fun and exciting way to switch up your hairstyle. With the right preparation and maintenance, you can achieve beautiful and long-lasting dreadlocks.

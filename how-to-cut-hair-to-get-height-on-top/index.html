Whether you're going for a voluminous quiff or a sleek pompadour, getting height on top requires the right haircut. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to cut hair to get height on top, with step-by-step instructions, tips, and advice on hair care.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Cut Hair to Get Height on Top</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Cutting Hair for Height</a></li><li><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for a High-Volume Look</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut Hair to Get Height on Top</h2><p>If you want to add height to your hair, the first step is to choose the right haircut. A layered cut with shorter layers on the sides and longer layers on top will help create volume and lift. You can also ask your barber or stylist to add texture with razor cuts or point cutting, which will add movement and body to your hair.</p><p>Once you have the right cut, there are several techniques you can use to style your hair for height:</p><h3>Blow Drying</h3><p>Blow drying your hair is one of the best ways to add volume and height. Start by applying a heat protectant spray to your hair, then use a round brush to lift the hair at the roots while blow drying. Aim the blow dryer upwards to create lift and volume.</p><h3>Backcombing</h3><p>Backcombing, also known as teasing or ratting, involves combing the hair towards the roots to create volume. To backcomb your hair, take a small section at the crown of your head and comb it backwards towards the scalp, then repeat with the next section. Use a fine-toothed comb to smooth out the top layer of hair, and finish with hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h3>Hair Products</h3><p>Using the right hair products can also help add height to your hair. Look for products that are designed to add volume and texture, such as mousse, volumizing spray, or dry shampoo. Apply the product to the roots of your hair and work it through with your hands, then style as desired.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Ready to cut your hair for height? Follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair and towel drying it until it's damp.</li><li>Section off the hair at the crown of your head and clip it up.</li><li>Starting at the nape of your neck, use scissors or clippers to cut the hair to the desired length. Keep the sides shorter than the top to create volume.</li><li>Move up to the sides and cut the hair to the desired length, blending it into the top.</li><li>Unclip the hair at the crown and cut it to the desired length, again keeping it longer than the sides.</li><li>Use scissors or a razor to add texture to the hair, cutting into the ends to create movement and body.</li><li>Style your hair using blow drying, backcombing, or hair products to add height and volume.</li><li>Finish with hairspray to hold the style in place.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Hair for Height</h2><p>Looking for some extra tips and tricks to help you get the perfect high-volume look? Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Choose the right cut for your face shape and hair type. A good barber or stylist can help you find the perfect style.</li><li>Invest in quality hair products that are designed to add volume and texture. Cheaper products can weigh down your hair and make it harder to style.</li><li>Don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques and styles until you find the look that works best for you.</li><li>Be gentle with your hair when blow drying or styling to avoid damaging it. Use a heat protectant spray and avoid using hot tools on a daily basis.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How long does my hair need to be to get height on top?</h3><p>You'll need at least a few inches of hair on top to create volume and height. If your hair is too short, it will be harder to style.</p><h3>What type of hair works best for a high-volume look?</h3><p>Thick, straight hair is ideal for creating height and volume, but you can still achieve the look with other hair types. If you have curly or wavy hair, consider using a straightening iron before blow drying to create a smooth, sleek base.</p><h3>Do I need to use a specific type of brush for blow drying?</h3><p>A round brush is ideal for creating volume and lift, but you can also use a paddle brush or your fingers to style your hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for a High-Volume Look</h2><p>Once you've achieved the perfect high-volume look, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it looking healthy and stylish. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo once a week to remove buildup from hair products.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on a daily basis to prevent damage to your hair.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to keep it looking neat and tidy.</li></ul><p>With these tips and techniques, you'll be able to cut your hair to get height on top and achieve the perfect high-volume look. Whether you're going for a classic pompadour or a modern quiff, with the right cut and styling tools, you'll be able to create a look that's both stylish and effortless.</p></article>

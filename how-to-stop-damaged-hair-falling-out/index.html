If you must use heat styling tools like flat irons or curling wands, use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.

Eating foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals like biotin, vitamin E, and iron can help to promote healthy hair growth. Some good options include leafy greens, nuts, and lean protein sources like chicken or fish.</p><h2>Step By Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Identify the cause of your hair loss</h3><p>Before you can prevent hair loss, you need to identify what's causing it.

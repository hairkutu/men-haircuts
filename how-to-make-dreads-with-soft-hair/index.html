However, the process may take longer and require more care to prevent damage. Before starting, make sure your hair is healthy and free of any chemical treatments or heat damage. Here are the basic steps to create dreads with soft hair:</p><h3>1. Choose the Right Method</h3><p>There are different methods to make dreads, such as backcombing, twisting, and braiding. For soft hair, the most recommended method is the twisting method, as it creates less tension and damage. </p><h3>2. Get the Right Products</h3><p>Using the right products can make a big difference in how your dreads turn out and how easy it is to maintain them. You will need a residue-free shampoo, a locking gel or wax, and a crochet hook for maintenance. </p><h3>3. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into small sections with a rat-tail comb. The size of the sections will depend on your preference and hair thickness. Some people prefer thicker dreads, while others like thinner ones. </p><h3>4. Twist Your Hair</h3><p>Take one section of hair and twist it tightly from the root to the end. You can use a locking gel or wax to help the hair hold its shape. Repeat the process with each section until you have twisted all your hair. </p><h3>5. Palm Roll Your Dreads</h3><p>After twisting your hair, you need to palm roll each dread to help it set and remove any lumps or bumps. Rub the dread between your palms in a rolling motion, starting at the root and moving towards the tip. Repeat this step every few days to keep your dreads tight and well-formed. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed step-by-step guide to making dreads with soft hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a residue-free shampoo to remove any oils or product buildup.

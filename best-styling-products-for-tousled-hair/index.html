It's perfect for those who want a low-maintenance hairstyle that still looks put-together. To achieve tousled hair, you'll need the right products that add texture, volume, and hold. These products can range from sea salt sprays to texturizing mousses, and they all have one thing in common: they help you achieve that perfect tousled look.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Style Tousled Hair</h2><p>Styling tousled hair is easy once you have the right products. Here's a quick overview of the steps you should follow:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair</li><li>Apply a texturizing product to your hair</li><li>Scrunch your hair to create waves and texture</li><li>Use a curling iron or wand to add more waves if necessary</li><li>Finish with a hairspray or other finishing product to hold the style in place</li></ol><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>For a more detailed guide on how to style tousled hair, follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Before you start styling, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Tousled hair works best on hair that has a bit of texture, so if your hair is too clean, it may be harder to style. If your hair is already a bit oily or greasy, you can skip washing it and just use a dry shampoo to add some volume and texture.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a texturizing product to your hair</h3><p>Next, apply a texturizing product to your hair. This could be a sea salt spray, a texturizing mousse, or a dry shampoo. These products add texture and volume to your hair, making it easier to style. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends.</p><h3>Step 3: Scrunch your hair to create waves and texture</h3><p>Once you've applied the texturizing product, use your hands to scrunch your hair. This will help create waves and texture. You can also use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to help enhance your natural wave pattern. If you have straight hair, you may need to use a curling iron or wand to create waves.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a curling iron or wand to add more waves if necessary</h3><p>If your hair is naturally straight or doesn't have much texture, you may need to use a curling iron or wand to add more waves. To do this, take small sections of hair and wrap them around the curling iron or wand, holding for a few seconds before releasing. Use a variety of curl sizes to create a more natural-looking tousled style.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with a hairspray or other finishing product to hold the style in place</h3><p>Finally, finish your tousled hairstyle with a hairspray or other finishing product to hold the style in place. Use a light hold product to avoid weighing down your hair or making it look stiff. You can also use a shine spray or serum to add some extra shine and polish to your style.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Tousled Hair</h2><p>Once you've achieved the perfect tousled hairstyle, you'll want to make sure it lasts as long as possible. Here are some tips for maintaining your tousled hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid washing your hair too often, as this can strip away the natural oils that help create texture and volume</li><li>Use a dry shampoo to refresh your hair between washes</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair too much, as this can flatten your waves and texture</li><li>Use a silk pillowcase to prevent frizz and tangles while you sleep</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can damage your hair and make it harder to style</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What is tousled hair?</h3><p>Tousled hair is a style that looks effortless and natural.

The dye can cause your hair to become dry and brittle, which can lead to breakage and hair fall.</p><h3>Overprocessing</h3><p>If you dye your hair too often, it can become overprocessed. Overprocessing can cause your hair to become weak and break, leading to hair fall.</p><h3>Scalp Irritation</h3><p>The chemicals in hair dye can also irritate your scalp, leading to hair fall. If you have a sensitive scalp, it's important to be careful when dying your hair.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Prevent Hair Fall After Dying Your Hair</h2><p>If you want to prevent hair fall after dying your hair, here are some tips to follow:</p><h3>Avoid Dying Your Hair Too Often</h3><p>If you dye your hair too often, it can become overprocessed and cause hair fall.

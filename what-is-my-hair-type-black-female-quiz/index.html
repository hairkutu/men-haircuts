Try using a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner, and use a diffuser when blow-drying your hair for added volume.</p><h3>Type 3: Curly Hair</h3><p>For type 3 hair, use products that define your curls. Try using a curl-defining cream or gel, and avoid brushing your hair too much as it can cause frizz and breakage.</p><h3>Type 4: Coily Hair</h3><p>For type 4 hair, use heavy products like butters and creams to moisturize your hair.

This means washing it regularly, using conditioner to keep it soft and manageable, and getting regular haircuts to keep it looking neat and tidy.</p><p>It's also important to choose the right hair products for your hair type. If you have thick hair, look for products that will help smooth and tame it.

First, look for hats with a wider brim, as this will help balance out the size of your head.</p><p>You can also opt for hats with a lower crown, as this will help create a more proportional look.

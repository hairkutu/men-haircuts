Here are some tips to help you get started:</p><h3>1. Change Your Hairstyle</h3><p>Your hairstyle plays a significant role in the appearance of your face shape. To create the illusion of a more angular face, consider getting a haircut that adds volume to the top of your head and creates a more defined jawline. A short bob or pixie cut can work wonders for a round face shape.</p><h3>2. Use Makeup to Contour Your Face</h3><p>Contouring is a makeup technique that uses shading to create the illusion of a more defined face shape. To contour your face, use a contouring powder or cream that is two shades darker than your skin tone. Apply it to the hollows of your cheeks, temples, and jawline to create a more angular look.</p><h3>3. Do Facial Exercises</h3><p>Facial exercises can help tone your facial muscles and create a more defined jawline. Some exercises to try include puckering your lips and holding for 5-10 seconds, smiling while pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth, and chewing gum to strengthen your jaw muscles.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1:</h3><p>Consult a hairstylist to find a haircut that flatters your face shape.

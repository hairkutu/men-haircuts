Make sure you have the right tools such as hair cutting scissors, a comb, and hair clips. You can purchase these at your local drugstore or online. It's also important to have a clear space to work in and a mirror to see what you're doing. Lastly, make sure your hair is clean and dry before starting the cut.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step to cutting your own long wavy hair is to determine how much hair you want to cut. If you're just looking for a trim, start with cutting 1/4 inch at a time. If you're feeling adventurous and want to cut more, start with 1/2 inch at a time. Remember, you can always cut more but you can't put hair back once it's cut.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h3><p>Step 1: Part your hair down the middle and brush it out.</p><p>Step 2: Take a small section of hair from the front and twist it tightly.</p><p>Step 3: Cut the ends of the twisted hair at an angle. This will help create layers and texture.</p><p>Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 on the other side of your head. Make sure the sections of hair are even.</p><p>Step 5: Take a small section of hair from the back and twist it tightly.</p><p>Step 6: Cut the ends at an angle. This will help create layers and texture in the back.</p><p>Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 on the other side of your head. Make sure the sections of hair are even.</p><p>Step 8: Finish by cutting any uneven ends or flyaways.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>1. Don't cut your hair when it's wet. It's harder to see how much you're cutting and your hair shrinks when it dries.</p><p>2. Take breaks if you need to. Cutting your own hair can be tiring and it's important to not rush the process.</p><p>3. Start with small cuts and work your way up. You can always cut more but can't put hair back once it's cut.</p><p>4. Invest in a good pair of hair cutting scissors. This will help ensure a clean cut.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Can I cut my own hair if it's curly?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your own hair if it's curly. Follow the same steps as cutting wavy hair but make sure to cut less at a time since curly hair shrinks more when it dries.</p><h3>How often should I cut my own long wavy hair?</h3><p>It's recommended to cut your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain healthy ends. However, if you're just looking for a trim, you can do it as often as you'd like.</p><h3>What should I do if I mess up my cut?</h3><p>If you mess up your cut, don't panic! You can always go to a professional to fix it or try cutting it shorter.

Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends. Avoid using heat styling tools as much as possible and let your hair air dry.

Bangs are a great way to change up your look, but they can be a pain to deal with as they grow out. However, there are ways to wear your hair while growing out bangs that can help you look great and feel confident. In this article, we will provide tips and tricks for wearing your hair while growing out bangs, step-by-step guide, tips for growing out bangs, FAQs, and hair care tips to keep your hair healthy and strong.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Wear Hair While Growing Out Bangs</h2><p>There are several ways to wear your hair while growing out bangs. One of the simplest ways is to part your hair to the side. This will allow your bangs to blend in with the rest of your hair and help them grow out more naturally. You can also use hair accessories like headbands, clips, or bobby pins to keep your bangs out of your face. Another option is to pin your bangs back with a braid or twist, which can create a cute and stylish look. </p><h3>Side Part</h3><p>A side part is a simple and easy way to wear your hair while growing out bangs. To create a side part, start by dividing your hair down the middle. Then, use a comb to create a part on one side of your head. Brush your hair so that it falls naturally over your forehead, covering your bangs. You can use a hair clip or bobby pin to keep your hair in place if necessary. </p><h3>Headbands, Clips, and Bobby Pins</h3><p>Hair accessories like headbands, clips, and bobby pins can be a lifesaver when it comes to growing out bangs. A headband can keep your hair out of your face and add a cute and stylish touch to your look. Clips and bobby pins can be used to pin your bangs back or to the side, creating a fun and trendy look. </p><h3>Braids and Twists</h3><p>Braids and twists are another option for wearing your hair while growing out bangs. To create a braid, start by dividing your hair into three sections. Then, cross the right section over the middle section, followed by the left section over the middle section. Continue braiding until you reach the end of your hair and secure with a hair tie. You can also create a twist by taking a small section of hair from one side of your head and twisting it back, securing it in place with a bobby pin. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to wearing your hair while growing out bangs:</p><ol><li>Start by washing and conditioning your hair as normal.</li><li>Blow dry your hair, using a round brush to smooth your bangs and create a side part.</li><li>Apply a styling product like mousse or hairspray to keep your hair in place.</li><li>Use a headband, clip, or bobby pins to keep your bangs out of your face.</li><li>If you want to create a more stylish look, try braiding or twisting your bangs back.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Growing Out Bangs</h2><p>Here are some tips for growing out your bangs:</p><ul><li>Be patient.

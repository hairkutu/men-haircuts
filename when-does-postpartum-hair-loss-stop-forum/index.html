It is caused by the hormonal changes that occur during and after pregnancy. During pregnancy, the body produces higher levels of estrogen, which can cause hair to grow thicker and fuller. However, after childbirth, estrogen levels drop, and this can cause hair to fall out at a faster rate than usual. Postpartum hair loss usually occurs within the first three months after giving birth, but it can also happen later on.</p><h2 id="sec2">When Does Postpartum Hair Loss Start?</h2><p>Postpartum hair loss usually starts around three months after giving birth. However, it can start earlier or later depending on the individual. Some women experience hair loss during pregnancy, while others may not experience it until several months after giving birth. The severity and duration of postpartum hair loss can also vary between individuals.</p><h2 id="sec3">When Does Postpartum Hair Loss Stop?</h2><p>Postpartum hair loss typically stops within six to twelve months after giving birth. However, it can take longer for some women, and in rare cases, it may not stop at all. It is important to note that postpartum hair loss is a temporary condition, and hair will eventually grow back on its own. In the meantime, there are steps you can take to help your hair recover and reduce the effects of hair loss.</p><h2 id="sec4">How to Deal with Postpartum Hair Loss?</h2><p>Dealing with postpartum hair loss can be challenging, but there are several things you can do to help your hair recover.

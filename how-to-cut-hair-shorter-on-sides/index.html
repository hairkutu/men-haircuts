This simple technique can transform your look and give you a fresh, new style. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps of how to cut hair shorter on sides, as well as provide some tips and tricks for achieving the perfect cut.</p><h2>How to Cut Hair Shorter on Sides</h2><p>Before you start cutting your hair, it's important to have the right tools. You'll need a pair of hair cutting scissors, a comb, and a mirror. Once you have your tools ready, follow these simple steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure it's clean and dry. This will make it easier to cut and style. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair, and then towel dry it or blow dry it until it's completely dry.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Use your comb to section your hair. Start by creating a part down the middle of your head, from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Then, divide your hair into two sections, one on each side of your head. Use hair clips to secure the sections of hair you're not working on.</p><h3>Step 3: Decide on the Length</h3><p>Decide on the length you want to cut your hair. It's best to start with a longer length and then gradually cut more if needed. Remember, you can always take more off, but you can't put it back on once it's cut.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Cutting</h3><p>Using your hair cutting scissors, start cutting your hair. Start at the back of your head and work your way towards the front. Make sure to cut your hair evenly on both sides of your head. Use the comb to help guide you as you cut.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>After you've cut your hair to the desired length, use your scissors to blend the hair on the sides of your head. This will give your hair a more natural look and prevent any harsh lines from forming.</p><h3>Step 6: Check Your Work</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, use a mirror to check your work. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure your hair is even and looks the way you want it to.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Hair Shorter on Sides</h2><p>Here are some additional tips and tricks for cutting your hair shorter on the sides:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer length and gradually cut more if needed.</li><li>Use hair clips to keep the sections of hair you're not working on out of the way.</li><li>Use a comb to guide you as you cut.</li><li>Blend the hair on the sides of your head to prevent any harsh lines from forming.</li><li>Use a mirror to check your work and make any necessary adjustments.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How short should I cut my hair on the sides?</h3><p>The length you cut your hair on the sides will depend on your personal preference. It's best to start with a longer length and then gradually cut more if needed.</p><h3>Can I cut my hair shorter on the sides myself?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut your hair shorter on the sides yourself. However, if you're unsure or inexperienced, it's best to go to a professional hair stylist.</p><h3>How often should I cut my hair?</h3><p>How often you cut your hair will depend on how fast it grows and how quickly you want to maintain your hairstyle. On average, most people cut their hair every 4-6 weeks.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After you've cut your hair shorter on the sides, it's important to take care of it. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair clean and healthy. You may also want to use a styling product to keep your hair in place and looking its best.</p><p>Now that you know how to cut hair shorter on sides, it's time to give it a try!

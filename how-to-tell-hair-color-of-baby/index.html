Hair color is determined by genetics, and it can be passed down from parents to their children.

There are two types of genes that determine hair color: dominant and recessive.</p><p>Each person has two copies of these genes, one from their mother and one from their father. Dominant genes are stronger than recessive genes, so if a child inherits a dominant gene for hair color, it is more likely that they will have that hair color. </p><p>For example, if one parent has brown hair (a dominant gene) and the other parent has blonde hair (a recessive gene), it is possible that their child will have brown hair because the dominant gene is more likely to be expressed.</p><h2 id="observation">Observing Physical Traits</h2><p>One way to tell the hair color of your baby is by observing physical traits. For example, if your baby has dark hair at birth, it is likely that they will have dark hair as they grow older. However, some babies are born with light hair that darkens over time.</p><p>Another physical trait to observe is the color of your baby's eyebrows and eyelashes. These can provide clues about their eventual hair color.</p><p>It is important to remember that hair color can change over time, especially during the first year of life. So, don't be too surprised if your baby's hair color changes as they grow older.</p><h2 id="predictions">Making Predictions</h2><p>While genetics can provide some clues about your baby's hair color, it is impossible to predict with certainty what their hair color will be. However, you can make some educated guesses based on your family's hair color history.</p><p>For example, if both parents have brown hair, it is more likely that their child will have brown hair. If one parent has brown hair and the other has blonde hair, there is a chance that their child will have either brown or blonde hair.</p><p>Remember that genetics can be unpredictable, so don't be too surprised if your baby's hair color doesn't match your predictions.</p><h2 id="tips">Hair Care Tips for Babies</h2><p>Whether your baby has a full head of hair or just a few wispy strands, it is important to take care of their hair. Here are some tips for caring for your baby's hair:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo designed for babies</li><li>Don't use adult hair products on your baby</li><li>Be gentle when washing and brushing your baby's hair</li><li>Avoid tight hairstyles that can pull on your baby's hair</li><li>Protect your baby's scalp from the sun by using a hat or sunscreen</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can a baby's hair color change?</h3><p>Yes, a baby's hair color can change over time.

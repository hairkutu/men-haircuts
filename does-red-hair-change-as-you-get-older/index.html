As we age, our hair follicles produce less pigment, which can result in a gradual loss of color. This process is known as graying.</p><p>While gray hair is a normal part of the aging process, it can be more noticeable in people with red hair. This is because the contrast between the white or gray hair and the remaining red hair can be quite stark. However, not all redheads will experience the same degree of graying, and some may retain their red hair well into their later years.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to</h3><p>If you are a natural redhead, there is not much you can do to prevent your hair from changing as you age.

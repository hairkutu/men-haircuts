Use a volumizing mousse or spray and blow dry your hair upside down to create lift.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when trying to create the illusion of thicker hair:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to help add texture to your hair.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils and make it look limp.</li><li>Try using dry shampoo to add volume and texture between washes.</li><li>Avoid heavy styling products, as these can weigh down your hair and make it look flat.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best haircut for fine hair to look thicker?</h3><p>The best haircuts for fine hair to look thicker are layered bobs, long layers, and pixie cuts.

The style you choose will depend on your personal preference and the occasion. Some popular styles for the men's side haircut style include the slicked-back look, the messy look, and the curly look.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with Product</h3><p>To complete the men's side haircut style, finish with some hair product. This will help hold your hair in place and give it a polished finish. Choose a product that works best for your hair type and the style you are trying to achieve.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Men's Side Haircut Style</h2><p>Now that you have achieved the perfect men's side haircut style, it's important to maintain it properly.

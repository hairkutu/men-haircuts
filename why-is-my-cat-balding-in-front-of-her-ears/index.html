Your vet will conduct a physical exam, which may include blood tests, skin scrapings, and skin biopsies, to determine the underlying cause of the baldness. Once your vet has identified the cause, they will recommend a suitable treatment plan.</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Allergies are a common cause of hair loss in cats. If your cat is experiencing an allergic reaction, they may scratch or bite the affected area, causing hair loss. Allergens can include food, fleas, pollen, and mold. Your vet may recommend an allergy test to determine the specific allergen and prescribe antihistamines or steroids to alleviate the symptoms.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p>Infections, such as fungal or bacterial infections, can also cause hair loss in cats. These infections can cause inflammation and itching, leading to hair loss. Your vet may prescribe antibiotics or antifungal medication to treat the infection and alleviate the symptoms.</p><h3>Parasites</h3><p>Parasites, such as mites, fleas, or ticks, can cause hair loss in cats. These parasites can irritate the skin, causing your cat to scratch or bite the affected area, leading to hair loss. Your vet may prescribe flea or tick medication, or mite treatment to address the issue.</p><h3>Stress</h3><p>Cats can experience stress, which can lead to hair loss.

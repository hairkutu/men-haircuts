If your cat is experiencing an allergic reaction, they may scratch or bite the affected area, causing hair loss. Allergens can include food, fleas, pollen, and mold.

These infections can cause inflammation and itching, leading to hair loss. Your vet may prescribe antibiotics or antifungal medication to treat the infection and alleviate the symptoms.</p><h3>Parasites</h3><p>Parasites, such as mites, fleas, or ticks, can cause hair loss in cats. These parasites can irritate the skin, causing your cat to scratch or bite the affected area, leading to hair loss.

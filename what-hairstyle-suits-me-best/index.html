Once you have determined your face shape, you can choose a hairstyle that complements your features.</p><p>Another factor to consider is your hair texture. Do you have curly, wavy, or straight hair? Each texture requires a different approach when it comes to styling. For instance, if you have curly hair, you may want to go for a shorter cut to avoid the frizz. On the other hand, if you have straight hair, you can opt for a long or short cut.</p><h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to determine what hairstyle suits you best:</p><ol><li>Identify your face shape</li><li>Determine your hair texture</li><li>Look for inspiration – check out magazines, social media, and celebrity hairstyles</li><li>Consult a hairstylist – they can guide you on what suits your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle</li><li>Try it out – experiment with different hairstyles until you find the one that you love</li></ol><h2>Various Options to Choose From</h2><p>There are various hairstyles to choose from, depending on your face shape and hair texture.

A layered cut or a side-swept fringe can achieve this.</p><h3>Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>A diamond face shape has a narrow hairline and a pointed chin. You want to add width to the forehead and the jawline. A layered cut or a side-swept fringe can achieve this.</p><h3>Oblong Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oblong face shape, you want to add width to the face.

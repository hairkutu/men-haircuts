When choosing a style, consider your hair type and what will be most comfortable for you.</p><h3>Ponytails</h3><p>Ponytails are a classic hairstyle that can be worn in many different ways. To wear a ponytail away from your face, gather all of your hair at the back of your head and secure it with a hair tie.

For a sleeker look, use a brush to smooth your hair back before securing it with a hair tie.</p><h3>Braids</h3><p>Braids are another popular hairstyle that can be worn in many different ways. To wear a braid away from your face, start by parting your hair down the middle. Then, braid each section of hair and secure the ends with a hair tie. You can also braid your hair to the side for a more relaxed look. To keep your braid in place, use bobby pins to secure it to the side of your head.</p><h3>Buns</h3><p>Buns are a stylish and practical way to wear your hair away from your face. To wear a bun away from your face, start by gathering your hair into a high ponytail. Then, twist your hair around the hair tie and secure it with bobby pins. You can also use a hair donut to create a more voluminous bun.

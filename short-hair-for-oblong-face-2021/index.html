But don't worry, we've got you covered! In this article, we'll show you how to choose the best short hair for oblong face 2021, including how to style it, tips, and hair care. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Description: What is an Oblong Face Shape?</h2><p>Before we dive into the hairstyles, let's first understand what an oblong face shape is. An oblong face shape is characterized by a long, narrow shape with a straight jawline and forehead. This face shape has a length that is more than its width, and it is often compared to an oval shape.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Short Hair for Oblong Face 2021?</h2><p>Choosing the best short hair for an oblong face shape can be tricky, but the key is to create volume and width to balance out the length of your face. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h3>1. Opt for Layers</h3><p>Layered haircuts are perfect for oblong face shapes as they add volume and body to your hair. You can opt for short layers or long layers, depending on your preference, but make sure to ask your stylist to create layers that frame your face and add width.</p><h3>2. Consider Bangs</h3><p>Bangs are another great way to balance out an oblong face shape. Opt for thick, side-swept bangs that hit at or above your eyebrows. This will create the illusion of a shorter forehead and add width to your face.</p><h3>3. Try a Bob</h3><p>A bob is a classic short hairstyle that looks great on oblong face shapes. Choose a chin-length bob with layers or soft waves to add volume and width to your hair. You can also try an asymmetrical bob that is shorter in the back and longer in the front, as this will help to balance out your face shape.</p><h3>4. Experiment with Pixie Cuts</h3><p>Pixie cuts are perfect for those who want a low-maintenance, edgy hairstyle. If you have an oblong face shape, opt for a textured pixie cut with layers and volume on top. This will create the illusion of a shorter face and add width to your hair.</p><h2>Step by Step: How to Style Short Hair for Oblong Face 2021</h2><p>Now that you know which short hairstyles work best for oblong face shapes, let's talk about how to style them. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>1. Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suitable for your hair type. Towel dry your hair and apply a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from damage.</p><h3>2. Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a round brush, blow-dry your hair to create volume and body. Focus on lifting the roots and creating volume at the crown of your head.</p><h3>3. Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron or straightener to style your hair as desired. You can add curls or waves for a more textured look, or keep it straight for a sleek finish.</p><h3>4. Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish off your look with a light hold hairspray to keep your hair in place.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Short Hair for Oblong Face 2021</h2><p>Short hair requires regular maintenance to keep it looking its best.

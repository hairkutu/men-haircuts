Brassy tones can be caused by a variety of factors, including environmental factors, heat styling, and even the water you use to wash your hair. In this article, we'll go over how to get rid of brassy tones in bleached hair and keep your locks looking their best.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#desc">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to Get Rid of Brassy Tones in Bleached Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips to Prevent Brassy Tones in Bleached Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Bleached Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="desc">Description</h2><p>Brassy tones in bleached hair occur when the hair takes on a yellow or orange hue. This is especially common in those with naturally dark hair who have bleached their hair to a lighter shade. The cause of brassy tones can vary, but it's often due to exposure to environmental factors like the sun, as well as heat styling tools like curling irons and straighteners. Additionally, the minerals in your water can contribute to brassy tones, especially if you have hard water.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Get Rid of Brassy Tones in Bleached Hair</h2><p>There are several ways to get rid of brassy tones in bleached hair, including:</p><h3>1. Use a Purple Shampoo</h3><p>Purple shampoo is specifically designed to counteract brassy tones in blonde, silver, and gray hair. The purple pigments in the shampoo neutralize the yellow and orange tones, leaving your hair looking brighter and cooler. Use the shampoo once or twice a week, leaving it on your hair for several minutes before rinsing it out.</p><h3>2. Try a Toning Treatment</h3><p>A toning treatment can also help eliminate brassy tones in bleached hair. These treatments are specially formulated to neutralize yellow and orange tones and can be used in place of your regular conditioner. Apply the treatment to your hair and leave it on for several minutes before rinsing it out.</p><h3>3. Use a Hair Mask</h3><p>A hair mask can help nourish and hydrate bleached hair while also helping to eliminate brassy tones. Look for a mask that is specifically formulated for blonde or bleached hair, and use it once a week or as needed. Apply the mask to your hair and leave it on for the recommended amount of time before rinsing it out.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get rid of brassy tones in bleached hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Use a Purple Shampoo</h3><p>Start by using a purple shampoo once or twice a week.

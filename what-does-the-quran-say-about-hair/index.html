Others believe that it is not permissible because it involves changing the natural state of the hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I cut my hair during Ramadan?</h3><p>A: There is no prohibition on cutting your hair during Ramadan. However, some scholars recommend avoiding unnecessary haircuts during this holy month out of respect for the sanctity of the occasion.</p><h3>Q: Can I shave my head?</h3><p>A: Shaving your head is permissible in Islam, but it is generally only done as part of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

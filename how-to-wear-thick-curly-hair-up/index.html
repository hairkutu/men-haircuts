One solution is to wear your hair up, but it can be tricky to do so without creating a frizzy mess. In this post, we'll show you how to wear thick curly hair up in a relaxed way that's easy to achieve and looks great.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Wear Thick Curly Hair Up</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Wearing Thick Curly Hair Up</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Thick Curly Hair</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Wear Thick Curly Hair Up</h2><p>There are many ways to wear your thick curly hair up, but some styles work better than others. Here are a few options:</p><h3>Bun</h3><p>A bun is a classic hairstyle that's perfect for those with thick curly hair. You can either wear a high bun or a low bun, depending on your preference. To create a bun, gather your hair into a ponytail and twist it around itself until it forms a bun shape. Secure it in place with bobby pins or a hair tie.</p><h3>Ponytail</h3><p>A ponytail is another easy and practical hairstyle for those with thick curly hair. You can wear a high ponytail or a low ponytail, depending on your preference. To create a ponytail, gather your hair into a ponytail and secure it in place with a hair tie. You can also use a scrunchie to avoid creating a crease in your hair.</p><h3>Braid</h3><p>A braid is a great option for those who want to wear their hair up but still show off their curls. You can either wear a single braid down your back or create multiple braids for a more intricate style. To create a braid, divide your hair into three sections and cross them over each other until you reach the end. Secure it in place with a hair tie.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know some of the hairstyles you can wear with your thick curly hair, here's a step-by-step guide to creating a relaxed updo:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.

Instead, gently squeeze the water out of your hair with a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to your hair to help define your curls and keep them frizz-free.</li><li>Using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers, gently detangle your curls.

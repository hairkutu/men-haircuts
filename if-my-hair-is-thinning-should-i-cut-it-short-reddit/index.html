One option is to cut your hair short. Cutting your hair short can help to make your hair appear fuller and thicker.

However, it can make your hair appear fuller and healthier.</p><h3>Q: Can hair thinning be reversed?</h3><p>A: In some cases, hair thinning can be reversed with the proper treatment.

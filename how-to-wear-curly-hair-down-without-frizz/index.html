Follow these steps to achieve smooth and defined curls:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner that is formulated for curly hair. Avoid products that contain sulfates, as they can strip your hair of its natural oils and cause frizz.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair while it is still damp. This will help to lock in moisture and prevent frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Curl Enhancing Product</h3><p>Apply a curl enhancing product, such as a mousse or curl cream, to your hair. This will help to define your curls and keep them looking smooth. Be sure to apply the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Diffuse Your Hair</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. This will help to enhance your curls and prevent frizz. Use a low heat setting and scrunch your hair as you dry it.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with a Hair Oil</h3><p>Apply a few drops of hair oil to the ends of your hair to add shine and prevent frizz.

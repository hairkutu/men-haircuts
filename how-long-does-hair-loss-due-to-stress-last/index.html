Temporary hair loss, also known as telogen effluvium, is the most common type of hair loss due to stress. It occurs when your hair follicles enter the resting phase prematurely, causing your hair to fall out. Telogen effluvium usually affects the scalp, but it can also affect other parts of the body.</p><p>The duration of temporary hair loss due to stress varies from person to person. In most cases, the hair loss starts 2-3 months after the stressful event and lasts for up to 6 months. However, in some cases, it can last up to a year. Once the stressor is removed, your hair will start to regrow naturally.</p><p>Permanent hair loss due to stress, also known as alopecia areata, is a less common type of hair loss. It occurs when your immune system attacks your hair follicles, causing hair loss. The duration of this type of hair loss also varies from person to person. In some cases, hair may regrow naturally within a few months, while in other cases, it may not regrow at all.</p><h2 id="prevention">Preventing Hair Loss Due to Stress</h2><p>The best way to prevent hair loss due to stress is to manage your stress levels.

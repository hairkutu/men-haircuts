Here's how:</p><ol><li>Stand in front of a mirror with your hair pulled back.</li><li>Take a closer look at your face shape. A square face shape has a strong jawline and a forehead that is roughly the same width as the jawline.</li><li>If you're still unsure, try measuring your face.

Here are some of our top picks:</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a classic short haircut that looks great on square face shapes. The short layers create a soft, feminine look that balances out the strong jawline.</p><h3>Bob Cut</h3><p>A bob cut is another great option for square face shapes. Opt for a chin-length bob with layers that fall around the jawline to soften the face.</p><h3>Asymmetrical Cut</h3><p>If you're looking for a more edgy haircut, consider an asymmetrical cut. This style features longer layers on one side of the head and shorter layers on the other, creating a dramatic look that flatters square face shapes.</p><h2 id="how-to-style">How to Style Short Hair for Square Face Shapes</h2><p>Now that you've chosen the perfect short haircut for your square face shape, it's time to learn how to style it. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Use the Right Products</h3><p>Choosing the right products for your hair type is essential when it comes to styling short hair. Opt for a lightweight mousse or gel that won't weigh your hair down.</p><h3>Blow Dry Correctly</h3><p>When blow drying your hair, make sure to use a round brush to create volume at the roots. Focus the blow dryer on the roots, then work your way down to the ends.</p><h3>Experiment with Parting</h3><p>Changing up your part can completely transform your look. If you normally part your hair in the middle, try a side part instead.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Short Hair with a Square Face Shape</h2><p>Short haircuts require regular maintenance to keep them looking their best. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Get Regular Trims</h3><p>To keep your haircut looking fresh, make sure to get regular trims every 4-6 weeks.</p><h3>Use Heat Protectant</h3><p>When using heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons, always use a heat protectant to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>UV rays can damage your hair, so make sure to protect it with a hat or hair sunscreen when spending time outdoors.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Square Face Shapes and Short Hair</h2><h3>What is the best short haircut for a square face shape?</h3><p>Some of the best short haircuts for square face shapes include the pixie cut, bob cut, and asymmetrical cut.</p><h3>Can square face shapes pull off bangs?</h3><p>Absolutely! Bangs can be a great way to soften a square face shape.

Use a conditioner that is appropriate for your hair type.</p><h3>Avoid Over-Styling</h3><p>Over-styling your hair can cause damage and breakage.

In this article, we'll be exploring some of the best short hairstyles for thick hair over 50 in 2021.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Thick hair can be a blessing and a curse. While it's great to have a lot of hair, it can be difficult to manage and style. This is especially true as we get older and our hair starts to thin out.

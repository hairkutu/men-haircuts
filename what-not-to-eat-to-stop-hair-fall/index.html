However, your diet can also play a significant role. Here are some foods to avoid to prevent hair fall:</p><h3 id="processed-foods">Processed Foods</h3><p>Processed foods are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.

It can also reduce the absorption of essential nutrients, which can cause hair fall. Try to limit your alcohol intake or avoid it altogether if possible.</p><h3 id="caffeine">Caffeine</h3><p>Caffeine can also dehydrate your body, which can make your hair dry and brittle. It can also interfere with the absorption of essential nutrients, which can lead to hair fall.

Pixie! Yes, that's right. The Pixie haircut is named after the magical creature from folklore because it has a playful and mischievous look. The Pixie haircut was popularized in the 1950s by Audrey Hepburn, who wore a short, choppy Pixie in the movie "Roman Holiday". Since then, the Pixie haircut has become a timeless classic that is worn by women all over the world.</p><h2 id="how-to-style-pixie-haircut">How to Style Pixie Haircut</h2><p>Styling a Pixie haircut is easy and fun.

If you have a round face, opt for a longer Pixie with layers to create an elongating effect. If you have a square face, go for a soft, wispy Pixie to soften your features. If you have an oval face, you can pretty much pull off any Pixie style.</p><h3>Does Pixie haircut require a lot of maintenance?</h3><p>No, Pixie haircut is low maintenance compared to longer hairstyles. However, you will need to get regular trims to keep the length and shape of your hair in check.</p><h2 id="hair-care-tips-for-pixie-haircut">Hair Care Tips for Pixie Haircut</h2><p>To keep your Pixie haircut looking its best, follow these hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every 2-3 days with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine by wearing a hat or using a leave-in conditioner.</li><li>Massage your scalp regularly to promote blood circulation and hair growth.</li></ul><p>That's it for our blog post about Pixie!

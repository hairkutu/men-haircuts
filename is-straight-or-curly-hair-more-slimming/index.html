You can also try air-drying your hair or using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to minimize heat damage.</p><h3>Q: What should I do if my hair is frizzy?</h3><p>A: You can try using a smoothing serum or oil to tame frizz. You can also avoid using hot styling tools on high heat, as they can dry out your hair and make it more prone to frizz.</p><p>We hope this article has helped answer your questions about whether straight or curly hair is more slimming.

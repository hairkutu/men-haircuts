Some of the most common causes include:</p><h3>Hormonal Imbalances</h3><p>Hormonal imbalances, such as an underactive or overactive thyroid gland, can cause hair loss in dogs. This type of hair loss is usually seen across the entire body and not just in one specific area.</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Dogs can have allergies just like humans, and these allergies can cause them to lose hair. Common allergens include flea bites, food, and environmental factors such as pollen or dust.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p>Infections, such as ringworm or bacterial infections, can cause hair loss in dogs. These infections can be accompanied by other symptoms such as itching, redness, or pus.</p><h3>Parasites</h3><p>Parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites can cause hair loss in dogs.

In some cases, your vet may recommend a special shampoo or topical treatment to promote hair growth.</p><h2 id="prevention">Prevention and Hair Care Tips</h2><p>While some causes of hair loss are out of your control, there are things you can do to promote healthy hair growth in your dog. These include:</p><ul><li>Feeding your dog a balanced diet</li><li>Regular grooming and brushing</li><li>Using flea and tick prevention</li><li>Keeping your dog's living environment clean</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Is it normal for dogs to shed?</h3><p>A: Yes, it's normal for dogs to shed.

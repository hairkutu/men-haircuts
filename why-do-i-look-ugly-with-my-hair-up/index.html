One of the most common reasons is that you simply don't like the way your face looks with your hair pulled back. This can be because you feel that your face looks too wide or too narrow, or that your forehead looks too big without your hair to cover it. </p><p>Another reason why you might feel that you look ugly with your hair up is that you are not used to seeing yourself with this hairstyle.

Talk to your stylist for recommendations. </p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>When wearing your hair up, it's important to take care of your hair to prevent damage and breakage. </p><h3>Use a gentle hair tie</h3><p>Avoid using elastic bands that can pull and break your hair.

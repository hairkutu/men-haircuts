If you're targeting professionals, muted and sophisticated colours like navy and grey might be better.</p><p>Next, consider the context in which your colours will be used. Are they being used in a logo, website, or print materials? The colours you choose should be consistent across all platforms to create a strong and recognisable brand.</p><p>Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things.

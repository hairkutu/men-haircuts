It is caused by an excess of androgens or male hormones, which can cause hair follicles to shrink and eventually stop producing hair. Hair loss can be distressing and affect your self-esteem, but there are ways to manage it.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Stop Losing Hair with PCOS</h2><p>The first step in managing hair loss with PCOS is to address the underlying hormonal imbalance. This can be done through medication, lifestyle changes, and dietary modifications. Here are some ways to stop losing hair with PCOS:</p><h3>1. Medication</h3><p>Your doctor may prescribe medication to regulate your hormones and manage your symptoms. This may include birth control pills, anti-androgen medications, or insulin-sensitizing agents. These medications can help reduce the excess androgens that cause hair loss and improve your overall health.</p><h3>2. Lifestyle Changes</h3><p>Lifestyle changes can also help regulate your hormones and improve your hair health. This includes regular exercise, stress management, and getting enough sleep. Stress can increase androgen levels, so it's important to find ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga, or therapy.</p><h3>3. Dietary Modifications</h3><p>Your diet can also play a role in managing PCOS symptoms and hair loss. A low-glycemic index diet, which focuses on whole foods and limits processed and refined carbohydrates, can help regulate insulin levels and improve hormone balance. Eating a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, such as iron, zinc, and biotin, can also improve hair health.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to stop losing hair with PCOS:</p><ol><li>Consult with your doctor to determine the best course of treatment for your PCOS symptoms.</li><li>Take medication as prescribed to regulate your hormones and manage your symptoms.</li><li>Incorporate regular exercise into your routine to help manage stress and improve hormone balance.</li><li>Eat a balanced diet that is low in processed and refined carbohydrates and rich in vitamins and minerals.</li><li>Practice stress management techniques, such as meditation or yoga, to help reduce stress levels.</li><li>Get enough sleep to help regulate hormone levels and improve overall health.</li><li>Use hair products that are gentle and nourishing, such as sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners.</li><li>Avoid harsh styling products and techniques, such as tight braids or chemical treatments.</li><li>Consider using hair treatments, such as minoxidil, to promote hair growth.</li><li>Be patient and consistent with your hair care routine.

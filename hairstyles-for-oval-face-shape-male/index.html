This face shape is considered the most versatile when it comes to hairstyles. However, with so many options out there, it can be overwhelming to choose the best one for you. In this guide, we'll break down the different types of hairstyles that suit an oval face shape male and provide tips on how to maintain your hair.</p><h2>What is an Oval Face Shape?</h2><p>An oval face shape is characterized by balanced proportions and a slightly curved jawline. The forehead is slightly wider than the chin, and the cheekbones are high. This face shape is considered the most versatile and can pull off various hairstyles.</p><h2>How to Determine if You Have an Oval Face Shape</h2><p>If you're unsure if you have an oval face shape, here's a simple way to find out. Stand in front of a mirror and trace the outline of your face onto it with a washable marker or lipstick. Step back and look at the shape you've drawn. If it's longer than it is wide, and your jawline is slightly curved, you have an oval face shape.</p><h2>Hairstyles for Oval Face Shape Male</h2><h3>Short Back and Sides</h3><p>The short back and sides hairstyle is a classic look that suits an oval face shape male. The hair is cut short at the back and sides and left longer on top. This style works best with a side part or a quiff. It's a low-maintenance style that's perfect for busy guys.</p><h3>Textured Crop</h3><p>The textured crop is a modern hairstyle that's perfect for an oval face shape male. It's a short style that's cut with choppy layers to create texture and volume. It works best with a messy fringe or a side part. This style requires minimal styling and is perfect for guys who want a low-maintenance look.</p><h3>Slicked Back</h3><p>The slicked-back hairstyle is a timeless look that suits an oval face shape male. The hair is combed back and held in place with gel or pomade. It works best with a side part or a middle part. This style is perfect for formal occasions or a night out on the town.</p><h3>Side Swept</h3><p>The side-swept hairstyle is a casual look that's perfect for an oval face shape male. The hair is left longer on top and swept to one side. It works best with a side part or a messy fringe. This style is perfect for guys who want a laid-back look.</p><h3>Buzz Cut</h3><p>The buzz cut is a no-fuss hairstyle that suits an oval face shape male. The hair is cut short all over with clippers. It works best with a clean-shaven face or a bit of stubble. This style is perfect for guys who want a low-maintenance look.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Hairstyle</h2><p>Now that you've chosen a hairstyle, it's essential to maintain it. Here are some tips to keep your hair looking its best:</p><ul><li>Visit your hairstylist regularly for trims.</li><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy.</li><li>Invest in styling products that suit your hair type.</li><li>Be gentle when drying your hair, as rough towel-drying can damage it.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat when styling your hair, as this can cause damage.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What is the best haircut for an oval face shape male?</h3><p>The best haircut for an oval face shape male is a short back and sides style, a textured crop, a slicked-back look, a side-swept style, or a buzz cut.</p><h3>Can an oval face shape male pull off a long hairstyle?</h3><p>Yes, an oval face shape male can pull off a long hairstyle, but it's essential to choose a style that suits your hair type and face shape.</p><h3>How often should I get my hair trimmed?</h3><p>You should visit your hairstylist every four to six weeks for a trim.</p><h2>Hair Care for Oval Face Shape Male</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential to keep your hair healthy and looking its best.

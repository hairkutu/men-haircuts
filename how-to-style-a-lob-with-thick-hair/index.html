Here are some steps to follow when styling a lob with thick hair:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, dry hair.</h3><p>Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and texture to your locks. Blow-dry your hair with a round brush to create volume at the roots and smooth out any frizz or flyaways.</p><h3>2. Add some texture.</h3><p>Apply a texturizing spray or mousse to your hair to add definition and separation. This will help create a tousled, beachy look that is perfect for a lob. Use your fingers to scrunch your hair and create additional texture.</p><h3>3. Use a straightener or curling iron.</h3><p>Depending on the look you want to achieve, you can use a straightener or curling iron to style your lob. For a sleek, straight look, use a flat iron to smooth out your hair and create a polished finish. For a more relaxed, wavy look, use a curling iron to add loose waves to your hair.</p><h3>4. Finish with a hairspray.</h3><p>Once you have styled your hair, finish with a hairspray to hold your style in place.

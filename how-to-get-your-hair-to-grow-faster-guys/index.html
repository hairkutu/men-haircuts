Try to avoid using these tools as much as possible, or use them on the lowest heat setting.</p><br/><h2 id="tip4">4. Massage Your Scalp</h2><p>Massaging your scalp can help improve blood flow to your hair follicles, which can promote faster growth. Use your fingertips to massage your scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><br/><h2 id="tip5">5. Get Regular Haircuts</h2><p>Getting regular haircuts can actually help your hair grow faster.

Use a cat-specific shampoo and be sure to rinse thoroughly. Avoid getting water in your cat's ears and eyes, and be sure to dry them off completely after the bath.</p><h3>Step 3: Provide a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Make sure your cat is eating a healthy, balanced diet that is high in protein and essential fatty acids. This will help to keep their coat healthy and reduce shedding.</p><h3>Step 4: Keep Your Home Clean</h3><p>Regularly clean your home to remove pet hair from carpets, furniture, and other surfaces.

Use the brush to lift your roots and create volume at the crown of your head.</p><h3>Step 4: Style your hair</h3><p>You can style your medium length hair in various ways, depending on your preference. You can create loose waves using a curling iron, straighten your hair using a flat iron, or create a messy bun or ponytail for a casual look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you maintain your medium length hairstyle:</p><h3>- Use a heat protectant</h3><p>When using heat styling tools, make sure to use a heat protectant to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>- Trim your hair regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h3>- Use a lightweight hair spray</h3><p>A lightweight hair spray can help hold your style in place without weighing down your hair.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What are the best medium length hairstyles for fine hair over 60?</h3><p>Some of the best medium length hairstyles for fine hair over 60 include layered bobs, long layers, and shaggy cuts.</p><h3>Can I wear bangs with medium length hair?</h3><p>Yes, bangs can be a great way to add dimension and frame your face with medium length hair.
